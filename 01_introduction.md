# Introduction

Bloodlines is a game of collaborative, structured storytelling. 
It is played with one game master (**GM**) and one or more **players**.
Each player plays the role of a player character (**PC**)which they create as the game begins. 
The GM designs and plays the role of the world around the PCs, including its cast of nonplayer characters (**NPCs**), including everything from elvish royalty to rival adventurers or hideous dungeon monsters.

The players and the GM work together to tell stories about the adventures of the PCs. 
They could tell an action story, where the PCs hack away at bloodthirsty monsters in defense of civilization. 
It could be a story of exploration, where the PCs venture into long-forgotten tombs in search of treasure. 
It could even be a tale of political intrigue, where PCs take advantage of instability to consolidate power. 

The story is played out scene by scene. 
The GM opens with a quick description; from there, play proceeds conversationally as the players and the GM improvise back and forth. 
Players may speak as their PCs and describe their actions, while the GM illustrates how the NPCs and environment respond. 
Players may also ask the GM for specific details to help them immerse themselves in the PCs' surroundings.

Play is punctuated by die rolls, which mediate the divide between player and PC; PC choices are made by the players while the success of PC actions is judged by dice. 
That is, the player decides which NPCs to attack and which to barter with, while the dice show whether a sword strikes home or a lie rings true. 
This dichotomy gives each PC quantitative strengths and weaknesses while still allowing players the freedom to play their PCs however they like.

The pages that follow explain how and when to roll the dice, but above all, Bloodlines is a social game. 
As such, the most important element is communication. 
The players and the GM are not opponents (even though the PCs and NPCs may well be enemies). 
Everyone has the same goals: telling a good story and having a good time. 
If anyone is unsatisfied in either respect, play should be put on hold to address the issue.

## About Bloodlines

Bloodlines reimagines classic concepts through a modern lens. 
The mechanics are built from the ground up to enable and reward the smart, immersive play style of early roleplaying games, as well as to emulate the radical symmetry and rules-lightness found in recent indie games. 
Similarly, Tolkien's influence is clear in the setting of Bloodlines, but his moral absolutism is not; conflict stems from opposing motivations and the will to survive, rather than from irredeemable evil.

In Bloodlines, Humanity finds itself inheriting a dangerous world. The ancient peoples are in decline. 
The savage wilderness, once brought to heel by their magic, rears its head. 
While the past age has been peaceful, these changes promise to bring ancient enmities to the surface. 
PCs may find themselves called to choose sides among multiple sympathetic factions.

The mechanics of Bloodlines exist solely to help the GM take the reins of this world, and to help the players immerse themselves in it through their PCs. 
To that end, the rules are concise, concrete, and consistent. 
While the pages that follow are full of examples to impart readers with an intuitive grasp of how the rules work, there are no tables to reference later, nor any obscure exceptions or corner cases built into the system.

Bloodlines uses just as many numbers as it needs – no fewer, and certainly no more. 
PC abilities are rated on a fine scale, allowing room for personalization and advancement. 
On the other hand, NPCs and roll difficulties fall on a coarse scale, making it easy for the GM to make quick, intuitive judgments.

While the rules are light, Bloodlines is not shy about its use of dice; it embraces the tactile satisfaction that comes with rolling a handful of them. 
Action resolution in Bloodlines takes a novel approach to dice pools. 
A roll can be made with just a word from the GM and a glance at the character sheet – no arithmetic required.

That is, Bloodlines is a roleplaying game boiled down to its essence: a setting ripe for exploration and adventure, a satisfying dice mechanic, and a lightweight rules architecture to bring them together.

## Game Materials

Bloodlines is played with papers, pens, and dice. 

Three kinds of dice are used: four-, six-, and eight-sided. 
It's best to have about a dozen of each. 
Each kind of die should be kept in its own bowl or tray, in order to make it easy for players to pick up a handful of a single kind: four six-sided dice, five four-sided dice, seven eight-sided dice, etc. 

Four-sided dice merit particular attention. 
Traditional (pyramid-shaped) four-sided dice are difficult to pick up off a flat table, particularly a handful at a time. 
Barrel-shaped four-sided dice are recommended instead. 

Other than dice, the table needs only pens and paper. 
The GM should have a notebook (or some scratch paper, or a pile of notecards) to keep their notes. 
Each player needs a character sheet for their PC. 
The last page of this book contains a blank one; additionally, they can be downloaded and printed from **website pending**. 
For added convenience, character sheets can even be laminated, so that wet-erase markers can be used to easily mark and unmark injuries.
