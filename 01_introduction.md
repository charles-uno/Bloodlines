# Introduction

Bloodlines is a game of collaborative, structured storytelling. 
It is played with one game master (**GM**) and one or more **players**.
Each player plays the role of a player character (**PC**) which they create as the game begins. 
The GM designs and plays the role of the world around the PCs, including its cast of nonplayer characters (**NPCs**): everything from elvish royalty to rival adventurers or hideous dungeon creatures.

The players and the GM work together to tell stories about the adventures of the PCs. 
The GM opens each scene with a quick description of the PCs' surroundings. 
From there, the players narrate their PCs' words and actions, and the GM illustrates how the NPCs and the environment respond. 
Players may also ask the GM for specific details to help them immerse themselves in the PCs' surroundings.

Play is punctuated by die rolls, which mediate the divide between player and PC: PC choices are made by the players while the success of PC actions is judged by the dice. 
That is, the player decides which NPCs to attack and which to barter with, while the dice show whether a sword strikes home or a lie rings true. 
This dichotomy gives each PC quantitative strengths and weaknesses while still allowing players to play their PCs however they like. 

The pages that follow explain how and when to roll the dice, but above all, Bloodlines is a social game. 
As such, the most important element is communication. 
The players and the GM are not opponents (even though the PCs and NPCs may well be enemies). 
Everyone has the same goals: telling a good story and having a good time. 
If anyone is unsatisfied in either respect, play should be put on hold to address the issue.

## About Bloodlines

In Bloodlines, Humanity finds itself inheriting a dangerous world. 
The ancient peoples are in decline. 
The savage wilderness, once brought to heel by their magic, rears its head. 
While the past age has been peaceful, these changes promise to bring old enmities to the surface.

The mechanics of Bloodlines exist to help the GM take the reins of this world, and to help the players engross themselves in it. 
To that end, the rules are concise, concrete, and consistent. 
They bring together the smart, immersive play style found in early roleplaying games and the elegant symmetry found in modern indie games. 

While the rules are light, Bloodlines is not shy about its use of dice. 
It embraces the tactile satisfaction that comes with rolling a handful of them. 

... 

Bloodlines is a roleplaying game boiled down to its essence: a setting ripe for exploration and adventure, a satisfying dice mechanic, and a lightweight rules architecture to bring them together.
