# Action resolution

During the back-and-forth between players and the GM, a player will often
indicate that their PC is trying to do something. In most cases, the GM should
allow the action to succeed uncontested. Rolls need not be made to find the
tavern in a new town or make small talk with a nameless NPC; the actions are
not difficult, but more importantly, their failure would not have interesting
consequences. If failed, the player would just shrug and try again, wasting a
few moments of game time.

On occasion, a player may declare their PC's intention to do something that is
truly impossible. In such cases, the GM may of course inform them of the
action's failure; no roll is required. More common, however, is that a player
(particularly an inexperienced one) will declare an action that is
inappropriately broad, vague, or otherwise discordant with the flow of play –
trying to play out an entire important conversation in a single roll, for
example. In such cases, the GM should ask the player to rephrase their
intentions instead of having the action fail.

In some cases, however, a PC will attempt an action for which success is
uncertain (or even unlikely), and for which failure is interesting. In those
cases, the GM will prompt the player to roll in order to judge the outcome.

Players can be called to roll for actions where the PC takes the active role
(by swinging a sword or telling a lie) as well as those where the PC is
reactive (parrying or sensing deception). The GM never rolls dice – if an
action does not involve the PCs, the GM simply decides its outcome.

Note that a wound should never be inflicted on a PC without allowing the
player a roll to avoid it. No matter how far a PC falls, the player should
always be allowed a roll to land without serious injuries; no matter how long
the PCs have traveled without food and water, the player should always be
allowed a roll to push on just a little longer. Even if these rolls are nearly
certain to fail, allowing – or forcing – the player to roll gives them a
degree of ownership over the consequences their PCs suffer.

## Rolls

When the GM calls for a roll, the player throws a number of dice equal to
their PC's most relevant bloodline score – note that, when using a spell, the relevant bloodline score is the one associated with the spell. If it's unclear which roll is most
appropriate for a given action, the decision falls to the GM. 

Each die that shows "1" is a **success**. If there are no successes (no dice
show "1") then the roll is a **failure**.

A single success is good for the PC – it means, more or less, that they succeeded
in whatever they were attempting. Additional successes mean things went
unexpectedly well. The details are left to the GM's discretion.

A failed roll means that something went wrong. This could be as simple as the
PC lacking the strength or skill to succeed. However, the GM is encouraged to
instead view a failed roll as an invitation to introduce a new and unfortunate
plot twist. For example, if the PCs are rooting out bandits in the sewers, a
failed Elf roll for navigation could mean stumbling into an ambush or
running out of torches (as opposed to having the PCs come back empty-handed).
In this way, failed rolls should be bad for the PCs, but still good for the
story.

Rolls can be made at four levels – **Minor**, **Significant**,
**Incredible**, and **Legendary** – which are made on four-, six-, eight-, and
ten-sided dice (**d4**, **d6**, **d8**, and **d10**) respectively.  That
is, a higher level roll is made on larger dice, making successes more difficult. Significant rolls should be the most common, while Legendary rolls should be reserved for actions that are truly outrageous, in order to preserve the tension that comes with the larger dice.

The level of a roll is judged holistically by the GM based on the
challenge in front of the PC as well as their approach to it. Sometimes it's
easier to pick the lock, while other times it's easier to kick down the door.

A player can exert some control over how the level is judged through a
mindful narration of their PC's actions. A reckless attack is more likely to
wound an NPC, for example, so the GM may choose to have it rolled at a lower
level. Similarly, picking a lock could be done at lower level if the
PC takes the time to do it carefully. There may be negative consequences as
well, of course; if a PC attacks recklessly, they'll have a more difficult
time defending themselves when the NPC hits back, and picking a lock slowly
gives any NPCs on the other side of the door plenty of time to prepare an ambush.

This goes the other way, too. A careful attack is less likely to injure an NPC
(and hence would be rolled at a higher level), but leaves the PC in a
more defensible position; the roll to defend against the NPC's next attack
could (at the GM's discretion) be made at a lower level. Picking a lock
quickly and quietly is very difficult, but if successful the PCs may be able
to catch the NPCs on the other side of the door unprepared!

Before a attempting any action, a player may ask the GM what the level of
the roll would be. This helps bridge the gap between player and PC. For
example, a GM's narration may not convey clearly whether a chasm could
realistically be jumped, but a PC standing at its edge would have a pretty
good idea! In cases where the PC would not know the difficulty of an action
(for example an attack on a heretofore unknown sort of monster) the GM may
decline to answer, only revealing the roll's level when the PC is committed and
the roll is at hand.

## Confrontations




During confrontations, play in Bloodlines becomes somewhat more structured. Rather than having each player participate conversationally, play is divided into rounds. During each round play proceeds clockwise around the table, with the GM's turn being last. 

A PC or NPC can only act if they were aware of the confrontation at the beginning of the round. For example, if the PCs are caught unaware by an ambush, only the GM would take a turn in the first round. Players would take their first turns in the second round, because they were not aware of the confrontation until after the first round started. 

This structure applies to physical confrontations (such as combat) as well as social ones (such as arguments or negotiations). However, it should be noted that social confrontations are often best modeled as a back-and-forth between one PC and one NPC, rather than an ensemble affair. If four PCs surround an NPC and all yell arguments simultaneously, the NPC is likely to flee or call in some guards rather than participate!

On each **player's turn**, that player narrates a few moments of their PC's actions. The turn culminates when the GM prompts the player for a roll. The level of the roll, and the bloodline score used for it, should holistically represent the entirety of the player's turn. For example, if a PC wants to stealthily approach an NPC from behind, then brain them with a hammer, the GM must choose whether to have the player roll Goblin (for sneaking) or Dwarf (for a melee attack). 

On the **GM's turn**, the GM may prompt each player for a single roll in response to NPC actions taken against them. The level of this roll depends not only on the level of the NPCs acting against the PCs, but also how many there are – a PC who allows themselves to be surrounded by Minor NPCs may be forced to defend themselves with a Significant or even Incredible roll! Note also that multiple PCs may be forced to defend themselves against the same NPC; a dragon surrounded by PCs may lash out with its claws, tail, teeth, etc. 

Rolls during a confrontation work in the same way as any other roll, with one quick caveat. For each failed roll on the GM's turn, the PC may suffer only a single wound; similarly, for each success on a player's turn, only a single wound may be inflicted on an NPC. If there are multiple successes, they may be distributed however the player chooses. Two successes can inflict two wounds on a single NPC or a single wound to each of two NPCs, for example. 

Rolls can have other effects besides inflicting wounds, of course. PCs and NPCs may want to restrain or disarm their opponents, flip over a table to create a barricade, yell distractingly to shift a character's attention, or use soft words to de-escalate the confrontation. Such actions can affect the behaviors of NPCs, even removing them from the confrontation, and affect the difficulties of future rolls. 

Note that there is no formal tracking of time or distance in Bloodlines, even during a confrontation. The actions of PCs and NPCs should be governed primarily by what is exciting and interesting, with realism being a secondary concern. Each turn within a round happens (more or less) simultaneously, even if some actions would realistically take longer than others. The relative positions of PCs and NPCs are only set to the degree that the players and GM narrate them.
