# Player Characters

PCs are characters played by players. In contrast, NPCs are played by the GM. They get their own chapter later. 

## Name

It shouldn't just be a name. Keep in mind that your PC has just been teamed up with strangers from half a world away. What makes you memorable? Perhaps a long family name? a distinguishing physical characteristic? your attitude? Where you are from?

## Foundation

Trade. Life is hard on the frontier. For the most part, you were probably defined by your job before your power manifested itself. What did you do? Were you a builder? baker? farmer? soldier? lumberjack? How advanced is human civilization -- do jobs like pickpocket and scholar exist? Probably? Subsistence farming isn't very exciting. This is something you can come up with yourself if you like -- the input of others isn't super important here. 

Power. Very rarely -- perhaps just a handful of times per generation -- a hint of ancient power manifests inself in an unwitting human. You are one such human. What is your power? Check out the appendix for examples or work with your GM to come up with one of your own. It's ideal that you have a power when the game starts, since people without powers are not adventurers.

Service. When your power manifested, you were drafted as an adventurer. On behalf of all of humanity, you explore the unknown and confront the dangers that live there. What onus, specifically, had been placed upon you? You should work with your group to figure these out. Not everyone needs to have the same task, but they should at least fit together. The PCs need to all share the story with one another, after all. 

Ethos. Even if you dreamed of being an adventurer, nothing in your life could have truly prepared you for it. How have you reacted? Do you embrace your new responsibility or resent it? What sort of world are you working to build for humanity? This is something you should talk to your GM and other players about, though you don't need to agree on everything -- disagreement can lead to interesting party dynamics!

## Bloodline Scores

The strengths and weaknesses of a PC are expressed through their four bloodline scores. These scores are numbers which illustrate how well the PC (as a Human) embodies the abilities of the four ancient peoples, and also show how favorably they are seen by the ancient peoples' gods. A Human whose Elf bloodline manifests strongly will be innately sharp-eyed, for example, and will take naturally to the magical domains of Aso and Osa. A strong Goblin bloodline, on the other hand, indicates a PC who is innately agile and looked upon favorably by Opochi. 

During play, bloodline scores indicate the number of dice that players use to make rolls. A higher bloodline score causes a player to roll more dice, which in turn improves the PC's odds of success in actions related to that score. 

The meaning of each bloodline score is explained in detail below: 

**NOTE: also mention spell domains here.**

+ **The Dwarf bloodline imparts strength, endurance, and skill-at-arms.** A high score will improve a PC's rolls to grapple, brawl, kick down doors, physically intimidate adversaries, run long distances, and use swords, axes, spears, and other hand-to-hand weapons. It also defends against melee attackers and exposure to the elements – the GM may request a Dwarf roll for a PC to deflect a grapple, parry an incoming sword, or stomach a poison.
+ **The Elf bloodline imparts knowledge, perceptiveness, and natural affinity.** A high score will improve a PC's rolls to forage, track, handle animals, make educated guesses, and recall facts about history, monsters, and geography. It also defends against ignorance and hidden dangers – the GM may request an Elf roll for a PC to notice an impending ambush, to recall a pertinent detail about an NPC, or to understand a new language being spoken nearby.
+ **The Goblin bloodline imparts reflexes, coordination, and stealthiness.** A high score will improve a PC's rolls to pick locks, pick pockets, move silently, and attack with ranged and thrown weapons. It also defends against detection and against projectiles – the GM may request a Goblin roll for a PC to remain hidden despite pursuers, or to duck out of the way of an incoming arrow or falling rock.
+ **The Halfling bloodline imparts social savvy, charisma, and willpower.** A high score will improve a PC's rolls to provoke, intimidate, barter, build rapport, entertain, create disguises, and lie. It also defends against deception and coercion – the GM may call for a Halfling roll for a PC to judge an NPC's trustworthiness, or maintain composure when faced with a tense or confrontational social situation.

Over the course of their adventures, a PC's bloodline scores gradually increase. This indicates the PC becoming stronger and more clever as a result of their experiences, as well as earning divine favor by amusing the gods. The gods are capricious, however, so these score increases manifest unpredictably. 

Bloodline scores are set at the beginning of each session. To do so, each player rolls twenty four-sided dice, plus an additional one for each session that's been played. That is, twenty-one dice are rolled at the beginning of the second session, twenty-two at the beginning of the third session, and so on. If any numbers do not show up (no dice show "1", for example), the roll must be tried again. 

Note that, rather than rolling physical dice, Wolfram Alpha can be used to instantly mock up such a distribution: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=roll+20d4

The die are divided into four piles by value. The sizes of the four piles are then assigned to the PC's bloodline scores. The relative order of the scores should remain unchanged from session to session – Tor Byorn Yorgensen always assigns his highest score to his Dwarf bloodline and his lowest score to his Elf bloodline, for example. 

## Conditions

Each PC has four checkboxes which are marked as they suffer injury. Each box corresponds to one of the four bloodline scores. As long as a given box is checked, rolls of the corresponding score will be more difficult: 

+ The **Broken** condition corresponds to the Dwarf bloodline. 
+ The **Dazed** condition corresponds to the Elf bloodline. 
+ The **Unsteady** condition corresponds to the Goblin bloodline. 
+ The **Shaken** condition corresponds to the Halfling bloodline. 

The next chapter illustrates in detail how these boxes become checked, how they become unchecked, and what happens when a PC runs out of checkboxes. 

## Notes

This is a large blank space at the bottom of the character sheet. It's meant for anything that the player wants to note as they play. It will likely start out empty, then accumulate little bits over time. 

This is a place to mark unusual items carried, relationships with NPCs, memorable exploits, rumors gathered from NPCs, thoughts to be referenced later, etc. This section doesn't have a mechanical effect – it exists to help add color.
