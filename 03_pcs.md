# Player Characters

*PCs are characters played by players. In contrast, NPCs are played by the GM. They get their own chapter later.*

> For examples in this chapter, and the following chapters, we'll be considering a game run by GM Gemma, for players X and Y.

## Foundation

Each PC is at once an embodiment of Humanity's heritage and a beacon of hope for its future. The common folk view them with a mixture of reverence and apprehension. Such a larger-then-life figure can hardly have an ordinary name! 

*It shouldn't just be a name. Keep in mind that your PC has just been teamed up with strangers from half a world away. What makes them memorable? Perhaps a long family name? a distinguishing physical characteristic? an attitude? a place of origin?*

> Player X names...

> Player Y names...

A PC's foundation is a set of **SIX -- two each for past present future** glimpses into the PC's life. They are not meant to be a full back story... just a handful of snippets to ground where the PC comes from, and who they are. Players should consider the following prompts when writing their PCs' foundations. It's also important to keep in mind that a PC's most exciting adventures lie ahead of them! 

Before enlisting as an adventurer, each PC had a **Trade**. Perhaps they were a builder, a logger, an innkeep, or a farmer. It's likely that this profession was central to their identity; the hard frontier life leaves little room for hobby pursuits. A PC's Trade hints at the sorts of tools they might carry, what NPCs they might naturally relate to, what problem-solving approaches come naturally to them, and so on. 

> Example...

Each PC's life changed with the manifestation of their **Power**. While such a power is just a whisper of the old peoples' magical abilities, it is enough to set a PC apart, unambiguously, from the rest of Humanity. The Appendix lists several example Powers, and also provides guideline from which players can work with each other and the GM to create their own. 

> Example...

Adventurers are pressed into **Service** for the sake of all Humanity. Their missions are dangerous – the recovery of powerful artifacts, the exploration of ancient ruins, or the capture of magical creatures, for instance – and often push past the bounds of Human knowledge. Players should work with the GM and each other to establish their Service, keeping in mind that all of the PCs need to belong in the same story! 

> Example... we need both for this one, to show how they fit together, so we might as well do both for all of them? 

A PC may have dreamed of becoming an adventurer, but nothing in their life could truly have prepared them for it. Their **Ethos** reflects how they have reacted. Does the PC embrace their newfound responsibility, or resent those who placed it upon them? What sort of future do they want to help build for Humanity? 

> Example... 

A PC's Trade and Power do not change over time. That said, if a player realizes after a few sessions that they're unsatisfied with the PC they've created, they should talk to the GM about retconning a detail or two. On the other hand, a PC's Service and Ethos may well change over the course of a campaign. Revisions can arise from the PCs' discovery of new information, a new assignment after a completed quest, a PC's personal development, and so on. 

## Bloodline Scores

Each PC has three bloodline scores which illustrate how well the PC (as  Human) embodies the abilities of the three ancient peoples, as well as how favorably they are seen by those peoples' patron deities. A PC whose Elf bloodline is strong will be sharp-eyed, for example, and will take naturally to the magical domains of Aso and Osa. A strong Halfling bloodline, on the other hand, indicates a PC with soft footfalls and a connection to Dina.

During play, bloodline scores indicate the number of dice that players use to make rolls. A higher bloodline score causes a player to roll more dice, which in turn improves the PC's odds of success in actions related to that score. Descriptions of the scores themselves are as follows:

+ The **Dwarf** bloodline imparts strength, durability, and a knack for provocation. A high score will improve a player's rolls to kick down doors, stomach poisons (or ludicrous amounts of ale), brawl, intimidate, resist fatigue, and fight with axes, swords, and other melee weapons. It also illustrates a PC's connection to the Dwarf goddes, Valka, who controls magic related to fire, metal, and stone. 
+ The **Elf** bloodline imparts agility, insight, and an affinity with nature. A high score will improve a player's rolls to handle animals, make reasoned arguments, navigate, track an NPC through the wilderness, predict the weather, and fight with ranged weapons such as bows. It also illustrates a PC's connection to the Elf deities, Aso and Osa, who control magic related to nature, storms, and the passage of time. 
+ The **Halfling** bloodline imparts stealth, charm, and a talent for tinkering. A high score will improve a player's rolls to move silently, deceive, pick locks, pick pockets, build rapport, create disguises, and fight with discreet weapons like daggers and slings. It also illustrates a PC's connection to the Halfling god, Dina, who controls magic related to enchantments, illusions, and other trickery. 

Over the course of their adventures, a PC's bloodline scores gradually increase. This indicates the PC becoming stronger and more clever as a result of their experiences, as well as earning divine favor by amusing the gods. The gods are capricious, however, so bloodline scores sometimes fluctuate unpredictably.

Bloodline scores are set at the beginning of each session. To do so, each player rolls fifteen six-sided dice, plus an additional one for each session that's been played. That is, sixteen dice are rolled at the beginning of the second session, seventeen at the beginning of the third session, and so on. 

The dice are divided into three piles by value: "1" with "2," "3" with "4," and "5" with "6." If any pile is empty (no dice show "3" or "4," for example), the roll must be redone. The sizes of the three piles are then assigned to the PC's bloodline scores. Note that the relative order of the scores remains unchanged from session to session. 

> At the beginning of the first session, fifteen six-sided dice are rolled to determine Oxye's bloodline scores. The result is 6, 1, 4, 4, 3, 3, 6, 1, 5, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3. That means that her bloodline scores are 5 (one "1" plus four "2"), 4 (two "3" plus two "4"), and 6 (three "5" plus three "6"). She assigns the highest score (6) to Elf, the middle score (5) to Halfling, and the lowest (4) to Dwarf. 

> At the beginning of the first session, fifteen six-sided dice are rolled to determine Tor Byorn's bloodline scores. The result is 1, 3, 2, 6, 6, 5, 2, 2, 6, 2, 4, 4, 5, 3, 5. That means that his bloodline scores are 4 (four "1" plus zero "2"), 7 (four "3" plus three "4"), and 4 (two "5" plus two "6"). He assigns the highest score (7) to Dwarf, the middle score (4) to Halfling, and the lowest (4) to Elf. 

**NOTE: explain why they prioritized those scores. also do the second session, to show that you roll 16 and put them in the same order.**

## Conditions

Each PC has three checkboxes which are marked as they suffer injury. Each box corresponds to one of the three bloodline scores. As long as a given box is checked, rolls of the corresponding score will be more difficult: 

+ While the **Broken** condition is checked, a PC's Dwarf rolls will be more difficult. 
+ While the **Dazed** condition is checked, a PC's Elf rolls will be more difficult. 
+ While the **Shaken** condition is checked, a PC's Halfling rolls will be more difficult. 

The next chapter illustrates in detail how these boxes become checked, how they become unchecked, and what happens when a PC runs out of checkboxes. 

## Notes

The final element of a character sheet is the Notes section. Use of this space is open-ended; players should use it to record anything they find important. A player might choose to note unusual items the PC carries with them, relationships with NPCs, exploits worth bragging about, or simply observations that might be useful later. Few details of this sort exist at character creation, so the Notes section tends to start out sparse, then accumulate content over the course of a campaign.  

> Examples: right off the bat, who adds what to their Notes? What do they add as they get going?
