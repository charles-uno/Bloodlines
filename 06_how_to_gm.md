# Game Mastering

**Maybe Alex will write this chapter for me. I don't even know if the title is supposed to be one word or two.**

**The section breakdown in this chapter is highly tentative.**

**how to guide your players -- especially new ones -- as they figure out their characters**

**coming up with Service** you can play this out with your players, or just figure it out OOC. 

**Conservation of Details.** Only use as many NPCs and locations as you need. Players can only keep track of so much.

**The GM is not the author.** Don't expect the players to follow a script. You can't predict their plays. Come up with a world where there are problems, and drop hints about them. Let the PCs choose which problems to address, and by what means. Problems that get ignored can cause complications down the road. 

**The GM is not the enemy.** Root for the PCs. Be a fan of the PCs. You're not trying to kill them, or beat them. You're providing challenges for them to overcome. 

**Length of a campaign.** Bloodlines is probably best for campaigns of not much more than a dozen sessions? Eventually scores get really high. 

## stuff copy-pasted from the how to play chapter that actually belongs here:

**TODO: a failed roll to cast a spell CAN cause the spell to backfire. remember how magic is unpredictable and dadngerous?**

**TODO: during combat, dropping your weapon or having it get stuck in something is an interesting problem.**


The GM should allow most PC actions to succeed without pausing for a roll. There's no need to check if the PC can saddle their horse, or find the tavern in a new town. These actions are not difficult, and, more importantly, their failure wouldn't have interesting consequences.

Similarly, the GM may decide that some actions fail, and decline to allow the a roll. For example, PCs might find it impossible to shatter a magical sword with a mundane hammer, or interrogate nonsentient monster. This should happen rarely; if at all possible, the GM should figure out a way to let the PCs roll for what they are trying to do.

The GM can interject at any time to call for a roll. They should do so when a PC attempts an action with two outcomes, both of which are plausible and interesting. A successful roll means that the PC gets more or less the effect they intended. A failed roll, on the other hand, should be viewed by the GM as an invitation to introduce a new and unfortunate plot twist. The failure should have an immediate effect, making it impossible for the PC to reattempt the same action, or at least raising the stakes.

A roll's outcome should never be that nothing happens. This ensures that, one way or another, each roll moves the story along. A few examples follow:

- **TBY dwarf roll example**
- While weeding out an infestation of cultists in the sewers, the GM asks Galadhel (who walks ahead of the party as a scout) for an Elf roll. If it's successful, the GM tells her that she hears voices up ahead. If she fails the roll, on the other hand, the party is ambushed.
- Before opening a door, Father Liam notices that the hinge is set to trigger a switch as it opens. He attempts to disarm it, prompting a Goblin roll. If he succeeds, he's able to disarm the trap and open the door safely. If he fails, the trap triggers, and the room begins to fill with icy water.
- Oxyehenhuain is caught out after curfew by two members of the city watch. She attempts to dispel their suspicions with a carefully concocted cover story. The GM calls for a Halfling roll. If Oxye succeeds, they politely escort her to her destination and continue their rounds. If she fails, they bind her hands, confiscate her scrolls, and lock her in a cell beneath the courthouse.

Rolling also gives the players a sense of ownership over the ills that befall their PCs as a result of rolls that go badly.

**Explain that rolls can only be made against other PCs with the player's consent.**

It's recommended that Significant rolls be the most common, and that Legendary rolls be reserved for the truly outrageous, in order to maintain the tension and excitement that come with the ten-sided dice.

As at any other time, rolls follow the story, not vice versa. Players should not think that a confrontation means that dice supersede roleplaying. For example, players should not presume to treat a social confrontation like they would a physical one. If four PCs surround an NPC and start yelling, it's not a social confrontation at all. The NPC is likely to flee or call in the guards, rather than engage the PCs in an argument. **social combat no longer exists**


It is the instinct of some players to react defensively: "I look at the floor and mumble an apology" or "I hide behind a rock". This isn't against the rules per se, but the GM should feel encouraged to push the players to act proactively: **what would the GM say to get TBY to engage with the duchess?** or **what would the GM say to get Liam to engage with the skeletons?**. **quick explanation of why you would do this -- it makes sure that, assuming you succeed on your roll -- some positive (rather than neutral) outcome makes sense.**


During confrontations, the effects of rolls are fairly consistent in magnitude. A failed roll is worth one wound on a PC. Each success is worth a wound on an NPC (that is, two or three successes on a roll has twice or triple the effect of a single success). Other effects are allowed, of course, and even encouraged. PCs can grab, tackle, disarm, taunt, distract, or reason with NPCs. They can interact with the environment, perhaps hiding or improvising a barricade. They can cast spells. These actions can affect the levels of future rolls as well as the behaviors of NPCs. However, the scale above should serve as a guide to the GM when narrating the size of each effect.

As at any other time, it can be difficult to think of consequences for a failed roll. A few examples follow. It also bears noting that the consequence of a roll need not be the same sort of effect that a PC was trying to create; the failed roll allows the GM to introduce whatever sort of effect they deem appropriate.

- While exploring a cave system, the party is ambushed by a troll. Tor Byorn attempts to climb up the troll's back to attack its head, prompting a Dwarf roll. If successful, he is able to mount it, distracting it and setting himself up for an easy attack next round. If he fails his roll, the troll lurches backwards, slamming Tor Byorn into the wall and inflicting a wound on him.
- Oxyehenhuain is engaged in a negotiation with a foreign dignitary. The GM calls for an Elf roll due to Oxye's inexperience with the language being used. If she succeeds, she makes a strong argument, and erodes her opponent's willpower, inflicting a wound. If she fails, she mixes up a word and mistakenly utters an offensive slur. She realizes her error and becomes flustered, suffering a wound herself.
- Brigands ambush the party, but luckily Galadhel escapes their notice. She draws an arrow and fires into the melee, prompting a Goblin roll. If successful, she drops a brigand in its tracks. If she fails, she instead misses and hits a member of the party instead.
- **Liam Halfling social confrontation example. For a greater diversity of examples, make sure that neither consequence inflicts a wound. Maybe lying.**
