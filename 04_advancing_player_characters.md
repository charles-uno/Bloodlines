# Advancing Player Characters

As PCs undergo ever-more heroic trials, their bloodlines in turn manifest more
and more strongly. In addition, PCs may find themselves developing magical
abilities as spells bubble up through their hereditary memory.

After each session, a player may **permanently increase any one of their PC's
boodline scores** by 1. It's most appropriate to increase a score that was
used more than usual in the most recent session – bartering with NPCs can
serve to strengthen the Merfolk bloodline, for example, and enduring harsh
environments can strengthen the Orc bloodline.

Instead of incrementing a bloodline score, a player may have their PC **learn
a single spell**. Learning a spell represents a small amount of magical
ability expressing itself through the PC. Spells cannot be taught; they must
arise naturally.

Each spell is a word. To cast the spell, the PC need only say the word, or
even hold it at the forefront of their mind. This can be done at any time.

While all PCs have access to spells, it bears noting that they are otherwise
rare. Most humans never know a spell; many never even meet someone who does.
Learning a new spell is always an event of note... though different sects of
Humanity disagree about which spells are good omens and which are bad.

The next pages list several example spells for each people.  Additionally, GMs
are encouraged to add their own in order to further illustrate the world the
PCs live in. It should be noted, however, that spells follow a specific
template:

Spells are in-world abilities intended to encourage open-ended, immersive
play. They do not deal explicitly with dice or bloodline scores. No rolls are
required to use them, though a player may still be prompted for a roll during
a spell's duration. For example, a spell may allow a PC to reshape stone as if
it were clay, but sculpting that stone into a particularly delicate form may
require a Halfling roll.

In fact, using a spell to make otherwise-impossible rolls is the whole point.
PCs can already do (or at least attempt) anything conceivable for a human;
spells add the ability to attempt things which are emphatically superhuman.

## Dwarf Spells

-   **Sharna**. The caster of this spell will find themselves able to reshape
    a  held piece of solid stone as if it were clay. As soon as they let go of
    it,  the stone reassumes its ordinary consistency.
-   **Yeutet**. This spell transforms a held piece of metal into a powerful
    magnet, or returns a magnet to inert metal. The magnet pulls, and is
    equally  pulled by, nearby iron and steel.

## Elf Spells

-   **Caibidil**. Upon speaking this word, the caster will find that the
    languages of people seem unintelligible, but the languages of animals are
    clear – note that this does not affect the intelligence of the animals, if
    any. The same word again reverses the effect.
-   **Eiadan**. This word must be held in the mind as the caster carves their
    face into the bark of a living tree. From then on, they may see through
    its  eyes at will. Upon casting this spell on a new tree, the caster loses
    their  bond to all former trees, though the carvings remain.

## Goblin spells

-   **Bong-tuy**. Holding this spell in the front of the mind allows the
    caster  to see normally in even complete darkness.
-   **Nyap-nyay**. Upon stepping into any shadow large enough to contain them,
    the caster may speak this spell to vanish, then reappear moments later in
    another nearby shadow (which must also be large enough to contain them).

## Halfling spells

-   **Anadl**. This spell enlists the wind to complete a small task for the
    caster – to lift, push, or otherwise manipulate an object. Note that the
    wind has the strength and dexterity of a child.
-   **Caru**. With this spell, the caster asks the wind to carry their words.
    A  short message can be carried swiftly across even great distances in
    this  way.

## Merfolk spells

-   **Aizhla**. Holding this word in the front of the mind allows the
    spellcaster to breathe under water just as easily as in air.
-   **Calamarsa**. This spell allows the caster to call down a rainstorm. The
    severity of the storm will depend on the climate – near the sea it may be
    torrential, while in the desert it may produce nothing more than a foggy
    mist.

## Naga spells

-   **Shenhua**. This terrible spell requires the sacrifice of four innocent
    lives to complete. Its effect is to return one dead person to life, in
    perfect health.
-   **Ssiwang**. This word allows the caster to ask a single yes-or-no
    question  of any recently-slain corpse. The corpse will answer truthfully
    to the best  of its knowledge, then crumble into ash.

## Orc spells

-   **Noama**. Casting this spell removes the caster's need for sleep, though
    they may still sleep if they choose to.
-   **Thelhoshar**. This spell transforms the caster into an indestructible
    quartz statue, and can be used again to transform back. Each
    transformation  takes several minutes. While in statue form, the caster
    maintains a vague  sense of their surroundings.

## Satyr spells

-   **Futya**. Sparks can be made to jump from any open flame with this word.
    The caster may direct them as much as an armspan in any direction.  The
    sparks are not large enough to wound a person, though they make excellent
    distractions and can ignite flammable objects.
-   **Nevma**. This word is used to summon or dismiss a tiny spirit made of
    fire, which hovers near the caster's shoulder like a torch. It can take
    simple instructions, though it becomes less obedient as it gets further
    from  the caster.
