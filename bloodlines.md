RolePlaying Game
BY CHARLES MCEACHERN



The world is old but Humanity is young. As magic's influence ebbs, and the ancient peoples with it, the world's dark and dangerous places are bequeathed to a people with only a whisper of their ancestors' power.

Some specific questions to keep in the back of your mind while playtesting:

Are rules clear? Is content presented in a clear order?

How do these dice feel? Better or worse than d4/d6/d8/d10?

How do the starting bloodline scores feel? Too high? Too low?

Is the current method of initializing bloodline scores satisfying? Do you feel like you have enough freedom to create the character you want?

Which spells are your favorites? Which ones are boring?

Do any spells seem overpowered? How about underpowered?

Does 4 feel like the right number of wounds for a PC?

INTRODUCTION

1
Bloodlines is played with one game master (GM) and one or more players. Each player plays the role of a player character (PC) which they create as the game begins. The GM designs and plays the role of the world around the PCs, including  its cast of nonplayer characters (NPCs), including everything from elvish royalty to rival adventurers or hideous dungeon monsters.
The players and the GM work together to tell stories about the adventures of the PCs. They could tell an action story, where the PCs hack away at bloodthirsty monsters in defense of civilization. It could be a story of exploration, where the PCs venture into long-forgotten tombs in search of treasure. It could even be a tale of political intrigue, where PCs take advantage of  instability to consolidate power. 
The story is played out scene by scene. The GM opens with a quick description; from there, play proceeds conversationally as the players and the GM improvise back and forth. Players may speak as their PCs and describe their actions, while the GM illustrates how the NPCs and environment respond. Players may also ask the GM for specific details to help them immerse themselves in the PCs' surroundings. 
Play is punctuated by die rolls, which mediate the divide between player and PC; PC choices are made by the players while the success of PC actions is judged by dice. That is, the player decides which NPCs to attack and which to barter with while the dice show whether a sword strikes home or a lie rings true. This dichotomy gives each PC quantitative strengths and weaknesses while still allowing players the freedom to play their PCs however they like.
The pages that follow explain how and when to use dice and miniatures, but above all Bloodlines is a social game. As such, the most important element is communication. The players and the GM are not opponents (even though the PCs and NPCs may well be enemies). Everyone has the same goals: telling a good story and having a good time. If anyone is unsatisfied in either respect, play should be put on hold to address the issue.

ABOUT BLOODLINES
Bloodlines reimagines classic concepts through a modern lens. The mechanics are built from the ground up to enable and reward the smart, immersive play style of early roleplaying games, without being bound by their mechanical eccentricities. Similarly, Tolkien's influence is clear in the setting of Bloodlines, but his moral absolutism is not; conflict stems from opposing motivations and the will to survive, rather than from irredeemable evil. 
In Bloodlines, Humanity finds itself inheriting a dangerous world. The ancient peoples are in decline. The savage wilderness, once brought to heel by their magic, rears its head. While the past age has been peaceful, these changes promise to bring ancient enmities to the surface; PCs may find themselves called to choose sides among multiple sympathetic factions.
The mechanics of Bloodlines exist solely to help the GM take the reins of this world, and to help the players immerse themselves in it through their PCs. To that end, the rules are concise, concrete, and consistent. While the pages that follow are full of examples to impart readers with an intuitive grasp of how the rules work, there are no tables to reference later, nor any obscure exceptions or corner cases built into the system. 
Bloodlines uses just as many numbers as it needs – no fewer, and certainly no more. Player character abilities are are rated on a fine scale, allowing room for personalization and advancement. On the other hand, NPCs and roll difficulties fall on a coarse scale, making it easy for the GM to make quick, intuitive judgments. 
While the rules are light, Bloodlines is not shy about its use of dice; it embraces the tactile satisfaction that comes with rolling a handful of them. Action resolution in Bloodlines takes a novel approach to dice pools. A roll can be made with just a word from the GM and a glance at the character sheet – no arithmetic required.
That is, Bloodlines is a roleplaying game boiled down to its essence: a setting ripe for exploration and adventure, and a rules framework that incorporates dice in a satisfying but unobtrusive way.

THE WORLD
AND ITS PEOPLEs

5
Map of the world.

6


At the dawn of the First Age, eight peoples awakened. For centuries, each lived isolated, oblivious to the existences of the others. 
The Second Age was a time of exploration, then colonization, then conflict. Cultures clashed with words and weaponry. Entire generations were lost to perennial warfare.
Finally, there came the Third Age. Historical enmities were set aside, for the most part, giving way to a time of coexistence, commerce, and prosperity. This age saw the creation of titanic monuments, powerful artifacts, and fantastical creatures. Its fruits impregnate every corner of the world.
It was not just culture and magic that were exchanged during this time, however. Through a hundred generations of political marriages and forbidden loves, bloodlines intermingled, giving rise to an entirely new people: Humans, whose rise heralded the opening of the Fourth Age. 
Humanity has inherited the strongest qualities of its parents – the wits of the Naga with the strength of the Orcs – but not  their magical gifts. Few Humans exhibit any magical ability at all, and the powers that do appear are modest.
As if in sympathy to Humanity's rise, the world's magic diminishes. Artifacts crumble. Creatures turn on their creators. What magic remains – for now at least – is chaotic and dangerous. 
This change has not gone unnoticed. Many among the ancient peoples view it as an omen that their stewardship over the world has ended. They gradually withdraw. The majestic Dwarven cities shut their gates; their populations dwindle. Elves take pilgrimages to the edges of the world, never to return. All the while, Humanity's population swells. 
Humanity is not the only thing that grows, however. As magic recedes, the wilderness reasserts itself, becoming more savage and feral than any time in living memory. Danger encroaches on Humanity from all sides. 
None can say whether Humanity is ready for the trials that lie ahead of it. If it does survive, it will be by the bravery and bloodshed of the heroes who strike out into the wilderness, beating back the darkness and exploring the unknown.

DWARVES
At the heart of the world are the mountains, and at the heart of the mountains live the Dwarves. Their mines and halls are nestled deep in the world's foundation.
Dwarves are short and broad, with earthy coloration. The men weave their beards into elaborate braids, and the women do the same with their hair. 
Dwarves are famed warriors. Their deep-sourced ores are crafted into exquisite weapons, which in turn are used to fend off the creatures of the deep.

Dwarf portrait. 
Elf portrait.

ELVES
To the east of the mountains, the foothills are blanketed by a dense redwood forest, home of the Elves. High above the forest floor, their beautiful cities are sculpted from living wood.
Elves are tall and gaunt, with long fingers, pointed ears, and green-tinged alabaster skin. Their hair is a mane of leaves, moss, and pine needles. 
The Elves are wardens of the forest. They are friends to both plants and animals, and watch carefully all who step within the borders of their realm. 

8


GOBLINS
The eastern edge of the world is wrapped in a lush mangrove swamp. The Goblins live here, their tiny huts clustered together wherever solid ground is to be had. 
Goblins are short and wiry, with large, bald heads and exaggerated features – their eyes, ears, and teeth seem far too large compared to the rest of their bodies. 
Goblins are devilishly fast. They are vicious hunters not because of tactics or weapons, but because there is no creature that can outrun them, whether on the ground or in the trees.

Goblin portrait. 
Halfling portrait.

HALFLINGS
Between the forests of the Elves and the swamps of the Goblins lay the rolling grasslands of the Halflings. Their small towns are surrounded by swaths of tilled fields.
Halflings are a short folk with smooth, round cheeks. They sport curly hair on their heads, as well as on the tops of their almost-always-bare feet.
Halflings are quiet artisans. Disinterested in danger and adventure, they are content to farm their grains, brew their ales, and whittle their trinkets.

9
MERFOLK
Tiny mountain streams merge and interweave as they flow east across the landscape, finally emptying into the sea. This watery network is the home of the Merfolk. 
Merfolk are an amphibious people with hairless blue-green skin and webbed hands and feet. They wear little clothing, but tattoo themselves heavily.
Merfolk are merchants and ambassadors. They travel the waterways of the world, brokering all manner of agreements between all manner of folk.

Merfolk portrait. 
Naga portrait.

NAGA
On the opposite side of the world from the great mangrove swamp, the sea is edged by desert cliffs. Upon these cliffs the Naga build their pyramid cities. 
Naga are serpentfolk. Each part of their bodies is long and slender, from their necks to their limbs to their tails. Their skin is bald and scaly, often covered in beautiful patterns.
Naga are scholars and astrologers. They study the motions of the stars and planets through cloudless desert skies, connecting their patterns to history and the cycle of life and death.

10


ORCS
The great desert runs from the western edge of the world to the central mountains. It is home to the Orcs, hardy nomads who travel endlessly from oasis to oasis.
Orcs are tall and broad, with heavy brows and jaws. Their skin color can be anywhere from sandy brown to a dark green. Their dark hair is traditionally tied tightly atop their heads.
Orcs are survivors. Their harsh desert home has made them strong and resilient; their ability to endure hunger, thirst, and extreme temperature is unparalleled.

Orc portrait. 
Satyr portrait.

SATYRS
The mountain peaks are home to the Satyrs. On the eastern slopes, above the forest, they grow their grapes; on the western slopes, above the sands, they gather brush for their fires. 
Satyrs are goatfolk, with cloven hooves and small horns above their ears. Their legs are covered in short, coarse hair, which can also appear on their arms and shoulders. 
Satyrs are hedonistic revelers. They gather each night around their mountaintop bonfires – from dusk until dawn they drink wine, dance, and put on plays.

CREATING
PLAYER CHARACTERS

13
The most fundamental aspect of a PC is the description. This is a place for the player to keep track of their PC's background, personality, motivations, and any other details that might be used to guide the PC's actions during play. 
Writing a PC's description can be a collaborative effort. Players are encouraged to talk to each other to figure out any relationships between the PCs, and what has brought them together. Players should also talk to the GM about specific details about the in-game world. 
The description also lets players contribute to building the in-game world. Any people or places mentioned in a PC's description become a part of the story... and can later be leveraged by the GM to create engaging plot hooks.
The descriptions is also used to illustrate the equipment each PC carries. There is no formal handling of items or currency in Bloodlines, so the description is used to judge holistically whether a PC seems like they would carry lockpicks, a spyglass, an extra weapon, rope, and other gear.
Players have complete freedom over their PCs' descriptions. They may update them at any time in order to track important or unusual items, new relationships with NPCs, and so on.
A PC's description – in fact, everything on the PC's character sheet – is public information. It need not be hidden from other players or from the GM. There is one exception, however; if a PC is specifically withholding something from the other PCs, that player may withhold the same information from the other players, so that it may be dramatically revealed later.

Art? Horizontal break?

Each PC can sustain four wounds. Wounds are boxes which can be marked off to indicate injuries, exhaustion, starvation, or any other sort of damage or stress inflicted on the PC. If all four of a PC's wounds are marked off, the PC is incapacitated. If a fifth would be inflicted, they are killed.
Wounds are recovered in dramatically appropriate time. A night of rest somewhere safe, or a hot meal, would each uncheck a single wound.

14


PCs are Human, and as such their abilities can be expressed in terms of their eight bloodline scores. These are numbers which illustrate how well the PC embodies the strengths of the eight ancient peoples. A Human whose Elf bloodline manifests strongly will be sharp-eyed, for example, while one whose Dwarf bloodline is strong will be skilled with blade and bow. 
During play, these scores give the number of dice that players use to make rolls. A higher score indicates that a PC manifests that bloodline more strongly, and as a result will be more adept at actions related to that bloodline.
Each bloodline score begins at a value of 6, which is average, giving the PC a good chance of accomplishing an Ordinary task of any sort. In order to demonstrate strengths and weaknesses, the player may then decrease a score by one in order to increase another score by one. This may be done up to four times. 
The bloodlines themselves are described on the next page.

Art.


In addition to bloodline scores, a PC's ancestry also provides them with spells. A spell is a whisper of the magical powers of the ancient peoples, which can bubble up through a PC's hereditary memory. PCs do not begin with any spells. They are gained between sessions as characters advance. They are discussed in the next chapter.

15
♦	The Dwarf bloodline grants skill with weapons and tactics. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to attack with blades, bows, and any other sort of weapon, as well as disarm, disable, and outmaneuver opponents. It also defends against armed attackers – the GM may request a Dwarf roll for a PC to deflect an incoming axe or sword.
♦	The Elf bloodline grants perceptiveness and an affinity with nature. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to navigate without a map, track an NPC through the wilds, handle animals, predict the weather, and forage for food and water. It also defends against hidden dangers – the GM may request an Elf roll for a PC to detect a trap or an impending ambush. 

Art.


♦	The Goblin bloodline grants agility and reflexes. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to run, jump, and otherwise move rapidly. It also defends against projectiles – the GM may request a Goblin roll for a PC to quickly duck out of the way of an arrow or falling rock.
♦	The Halfling bloodline grants stealth and dexterity. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to pick locks, pick pockets, move silently through the shadows, and travel without leaving a trail. It also defends against detection – the GM may request a Halfling roll for a PC to avoid being found by NPCs.  

16


♦	The Merfolk bloodline grants persuasiveness and willpower. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to barter, build rapport, and solicit aid, as well as taunt and intimidate. It also defends against provocation – the GM may request a Merfolk roll for a PC to maintain their composure when confronted with a tense or coercive social situation.   
♦	The Naga bloodline grants knowledge and experience. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to know history, nobility, monster descriptions, etc. It also defends against ignorance – the GM may request a Naga roll for for the PC to understand a language being spoken nearby, or to recall pertinent lore about a specific monster or artifact.

Art.

♦	The Orc bloodline grants strength and endurance. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to kick down doors, lift heavy things, run long distances, and engage in grapples. It also defends against exposure – the GM may request an Orc roll for a PC to resist the effects of poison, or to persevere for days without food, water, or shelter.
♦	The Satyr bloodline grants skill at entertainment and deception. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to sing, dance, act, and play musical instruments, as well as to lie, create disguises (for themselves or others), and maintain false identities. It also defends against deception – the GM may request a Satyr roll for a PC to judge an NPC's trustworthiness.

17
EXAMPLE PC: FATHER LIAM
Father Liam is described as follows:
Father William "Liam" Ingebert Sweetleaf is the former headmaster of Madam Dolores's Orphanage in Threebridges. A trickster by nature, he was run out of the orphanage (and the town) after Madam Dolores herself discovered that he was training the children to be pickpockets.
Since then, Father Liam has traveled the countryside surviving on his wits and ability to deceive. When entering a new community, he often creates a new persona and a disguise to go with it, using them to con people out of their possessions until he is – inevitably – discovered and run out of town again. He is currently traveling disguised as a priest and apothecary, and as such carries a thurible which he uses like a flail when the need arises.
Father Liam takes +2 to his Satyr bloodline to account for his deceptive nature and his penchant for false identities. He also takes +1 to his Halfling bloodline and +1 to his Elf bloodline – he was once a street-wise scoundrel, after all.
In exchange, he takes -2 to his Orc bloodline, -1 to his Dwarf bloodline, and -1 to his Goblin bloodline. He's never done an honest day of labor or training in his life, and it's been a long time since he had to flee down a narrow alleyway!

EXAMPLE PC: GALADHEL
Galadhel is described as follows:
Galadhel was born a bastard in the tiny village of Dragbor. Her mother always told her that she had Elven blood coursing through her veins, but Galadhel believed that this was a lie told to her to hide her father's identity and her mother's shame. 
She was a rambunctious child who took quickly to the bow and ran wild with the forest creatures. She clashed constantly with the elders of her village, as in Dragbor the authoritarian council prescribed the path of everyone's life from birth to death. 
When they told her she must settle down to be a seamstress like her mother, Galadhel instead fled from the village. With her new found freedom, she decided to track down her absent father and join him in whatever adventures he must be having.
Galadhel takes +2 to her Elf bloodline to demonstrate her natural affinity for the woods and woodland creatures. She also takes +2 to her Dwarf bloodline to explain her skill with a bow.
In exchange, she takes -2 each to her Merfolk and Satyr bloodlines. She is hot-tempered and impatient, with nothing but contempt for those in positions of authority.



Art.

19
EXAMPLE PC: OXYEHENHUAIN
Oxyehenhuain is described as follows: 
Oxyehenhuain was born in a large city along the edge of a wide waterway. Brought up under a strict caste structure, Oxye was selected at an early age to be trained as a diplomat and scholar. She excelled at both tasks, memorizing mountains of scrolls while learning nearly every language spoken on the continent.
Oxye's life of quiet study was interrupted when an ill omen – a red comet – appeared in the night sky. Sensing that a massive change in the world was nigh, Oxye decided to venture out to discover what was wrong firsthand. With no experience of the outside world save for what she had read in ancient texts, Oxye crammed as many scrolls as would fit in her bag and headed out into the great wide world.
Oxyehenhuain takes +2 to her Merfolk bloodline to reflect her immaculate manners and patient demeanor. She also takes +2 to her Naga bloodline – her knowledge, particularly of the history and languages of the world, is impressive. 
In exchange, she takes -1 each to her Dwarf, Elf, Goblin, and Orc bloodlines. Her studious life has done little to prepare her for the dangers found outside of court. 



Art.



20


EXAMPLE PC: TOR BYORN YORGENSEN
Tor Byorn Yorgensen is described as follows:
Tor Byorn Yorgensen is a sturdy young man from the mountains whose shoulders are impressively wide and whose arms and legs bulge with barely contained strength. Although he has a deep sense of honor and duty towards those who cannot defend themselves, he is bullheaded and has an abrasive personality that makes him difficult to get along with – so difficult in fact that he was exiled from his village and told not to return until he learned some manners. 
Ever since, Tor Byorn has survived by being too tough (and too stubborn) to die. He is never far from his two-handed hammer, with which he often charges in to fights that do not concern him to defend those he views as in need of help (whether they agree or not)!
Tor Byorn takes +2 to his Orc bloodline. He is built powerfully, and his time wandering the wilderness has left him toughened. He also takes +2 to his Dwarf bloodline, to show his proficiency with his hammer. 
In exchange, he takes -2 each to his Satyr and Naga bloodlines – he's not one for subtlety, or for books.

ADVANCING
PLAYER CHARACTERS

23
As PCs undergo ever-more heroic trials, their bloodlines in turn manifest more and more strongly. In addition, PCs may find themselves developing magical abilities as spells bubble up through their hereditary memory. 
After each session, a player may permanently increase any one of their PC's boodline scores by 1. It's most appropriate to increase a score that was used more than usual in the most recent session – bartering with NPCs can serve to strengthen the Merfolk bloodline, for example, and enduring harsh environments can strengthen the Orc bloodline.
Instead of incrementing a bloodline score, a player may have their PC learn a single spell. Learning a spell represents a small amount of magical ability expressing itself through the PC. Spells cannot be taught; they must arise naturally. 
Each spell is a word. To cast the spell, the PC need only say the word, or even hold it at the forefront of their mind. This can be done at any time. 







Art.

24


While all PCs have access to spells, it bears noting that they are otherwise rare. Most humans never know a spell; many never even meet someone who does. Learning a new spell is always an event of note... though different sects of Humanity disagree about which spells are good omens and which are bad. 
The next pages list several example spells for each people. Additionally, GMs are encouraged to add their own in order to further illustrate the world the PCs live in. It should be noted, however, that spells follow a specific template:
Spells are in-world abilities intended to encourage open-ended, immersive play. They do not deal explicitly with dice or bloodline scores. No rolls are required to use them, though a player may still be prompted for a roll during a spell's duration. For example, a spell may allow a PC to reshape stone as if it were clay, but sculpting that stone into a particularly delicate form may require a Halfling roll.  
In fact, using a spell to make otherwise-impossible rolls is the whole point. PCs can already do (or at least attempt) anything conceivable for a human; spells add the ability to attempt things which are emphatically superhuman. 

25
DWARF SPELLS
♦	Sharna. The caster of this spell will find themselves able to reshape a held piece of solid stone as if it were clay. As soon as they let go of it, the stone reassumes its ordinary consistency.
♦	Yeutet. This spell transforms a held piece of metal into a powerful magnet, or returns a magnet to inert metal. The magnet pulls, and is equally pulled by, nearby iron and steel.
ELF SPELLS
♦	Caibidil. Upon speaking this word, the caster will find that the languages of people seem unintelligible, but the languages of animals are clear – note that this does not affect the intelligence of the animals, if any. The same word again reverses the effect. 
♦	Eiadan. This word must be held in the mind as the caster carves their face into the bark of a living tree. From then on, they may see through its eyes at will. Upon casting this spell on a new tree, the caster loses their bond to all former trees, though the carvings remain.

26


GOBLIN SPELLS
♦	Bong-tuy. Holding this spell in the front of the mind allows the caster to see normally in even complete darkness.
♦	Nyap-nyay. Upon stepping into any shadow large enough to contain them, the caster may speak this spell to vanish, then reappear moments later in another nearby shadow (which must also be large enough to contain them). 
HALFLING SPELLS
♦	Anadl. This spell enlists the wind to complete a small task for the caster – to lift, push, or otherwise manipulate an object. Note that the wind has the strength and dexterity of a child.
♦	Caru. With this spell, the caster asks the wind to carry their words. A short message can be carried swiftly across even great distances in this way.

27
MERFOLK SPELLS
♦	Aizhla. Holding this word in the front of the mind allows the spellcaster to breathe under water just as easily as in air.
♦	Calamarsa. This spell allows the caster to call down a rainstorm. The severity of the storm will depend on the climate – near the sea it may be torrential, while in the desert it may produce nothing more than a foggy mist.
NAGA SPELLS
♦	Shenhua. This terrible spell requires the sacrifice of four innocent lives to complete. Its effect is to return one dead person to life, in perfect health.
♦	Ssiwang. This word allows the caster to ask a single yes-or-no question of any recently-slain corpse. The corpse will answer truthfully to the best of its knowledge, then crumble into ash. 

28


ORC SPELLS
♦	Noama. Casting this spell removes the caster's need for sleep, though they may still sleep if they choose to.
♦	Thelhoshar. This spell transforms the caster into an indestructible quartz statue, and can be used again to transform back. Each transformation takes several minutes. While in statue form, the caster maintains a vague sense of their surroundings. 
SATYR SPELLS
♦	Futya. Sparks can be made to jump from any open flame with this word. The caster may direct them as much as an armspan in any direction. The sparks are not large enough to wound a person, though they make excellent distractions and can ignite flammable objects.
♦	Nevma. This word is used to summon or dismiss a tiny spirit made of fire, which hovers near the caster's shoulder like a torch. It can take simple instructions, though it becomes less obedient as it gets further from the caster.

ACTION RESOLUTION

31
During the back-and-forth between players and the GM, a player will often indicate that their PC is trying to do something. In most cases, the GM should allow the action to succeed uncontested. Rolls need not be made to find the tavern in a new town or make small talk with a nameless NPC; the actions are not difficult, but more importantly, their failure would not have interesting consequences. If failed, the player would just shrug and try again, wasting a few moments of game time. 
On occasion, a player may declare their PC's intention to do something that is truly impossible. In such cases, the GM may of course inform them of the action's failure; no roll is required. More common, however, is that a player (particularly an inexperienced one) will declare an action that is inappropriately broad, vague, or otherwise discordant with the flow of play – trying to play out an entire important conversation in a single roll, for example. In such cases, the GM should ask the player to rephrase their intentions instead of having the action fail. 
In some cases, however, a PC will attempt an action for which success is uncertain (or even unlikely), and for which failure is interesting. In those cases, the GM will prompt the player to roll in order to judge the outcome.
Players can be called to roll for actions where the PC takes the active role (by swinging a sword or telling a lie) as well as those where the PC is reactive (parrying or sensing deception). The GM never rolls dice – if an action does not involve the PCs, the GM simply decides its outcome. 
Note that a wound should never be inflicted on a PC without allowing the player a roll to avoid it. No matter how far a PC falls, the player should always be allowed a roll to land without serious injuries; no matter how long the PCs have traveled without food and water, the player should always be allowed a roll to push on just a little longer. Even if these rolls are nearly certain to fail, allowing – or forcing – the player to roll gives them a degree of ownership over the consequences their PCs suffer.

32


ROLLS
When the GM calls for a roll, the player throws a number of dice equal to their PC's most relevant bloodline score. When using a spell, note that the appropriate bloodline score may not be the one associated with the spell – for example, summoning a fire spirit is a Satyr spell, but nicely asking it to obey your commands would be a Merfolk roll. If it's unclear which roll is most appropriate for a given action, the decision falls to the GM. 
Each die that shows "1" is a success. If there are no successes (no dice show "1") then the roll is a failure. 
A single success is good for the PC – it means, roughly, that they succeeded in whatever they were attempting. Additional successes mean things went unexpectedly well. The details are left to the GM's discretion. 
A failed roll means that something went wrong. This could be as simple as the PC lacking the strength or skill to succeed. However, the GM is  encouraged to instead view a failed roll as an invitation to introduce a new and unfortunate plot twist. For example, if the PCs are rooting out bandits in the sewers, a failed Ranger roll for navigation could mean stumbling into an ambush or running out of torches (as opposed to having the PCs come back empty-handed). In this way, failed rolls should be bad for the PCs, but still good for the story.
Rolls can be made at four difficulties – Ordinary, Remarkable, Incredible, and Legendary – which are made on six-, eight-, ten-, and twelve-sided dice (d6, d8, d10, and d12) respectively. That is, a more difficult roll is made on larger dice, making successes rarer. It's recommended that Incredible and Legendary rolls be prompted rarely – only for the truly outrageous – in order to preserve the tension that comes with the larger dice.
The difficulty of a roll is judged holistically by the GM based on the challenge in front of the PC as well as their approach to it. Sometimes it's easier to pick the lock, while other times it's easier to kick down the door.

33
A player can exert some control over how the difficulty is judged through a mindful narration of their PC's actions. A reckless attack is more likely to wound an NPC, for example, so the GM may choose to have it rolled at a lower difficulty. Similarly, picking a lock could be done at lower difficulty if the PC takes the time to do it carefully. There may be negative consequences as well, of course; if a PC attacks recklessly, they'll have a more difficult time defending themselves when the NPC hits back, and picking a lock slowly gives any NPCs on the other side of the door plenty of time to respond.
This goes the other way, too. A careful attack is less likely to injure an NPC (and hence would be rolled at a higher difficulty), but leaves the PC in a more defensible position; the roll to defend against the NPC's next attack could (at the GM's discretion) be made at a lower difficulty. Picking a lock quickly and quietly is very difficult, but if successful the PCs may be able to catch the NPCs on the other side of the door unprepared!





Art.





Before a attempting any action, a player may ask the GM what the difficulty of the roll would be. This helps bridge the gap between player and PC – for example, a GM's narration may not convey clearly whether a chasm could realistically be jumped, but a PC standing at its edge would have a pretty good idea! In cases where the PC would not know the difficulty of an action (for example an attack on a heretofore unknown sort of monster) the GM may decline to answer, only revealing the difficulty when the PC is committed and the roll is at hand.

COMBAT
During physical confrontations, Bloodlines becomes somewhat more structured. Play proceeds in rounds, the table is divided into zones, and PCs and NPCs are represented within those zones by miniatures. 
As combat begins, the GM will sketch out the area surrounding the PCs and divide it into zones. In general, a zone's width should be the distance a PC can move in a few moments – about five armspans on flat ground, and less in the presence of obstacles and difficult terrain. Miniatures are used to illustrate which PCs and NPCs are in each zone.
Any two characters in the same zone are close. They can speak to one another, attack one another with melee weapons, and so on. Characters can shout into adjacent zones and attack with ranged and thrown weapons. Characters in non-adjacent zones may be aware of one another, but cannot otherwise interact. 
Each round, the players and the GM each take a turn, with the GM's turn being last. The turns may be taken in any order, though clockwise around the table is recommended. 
Note that a character does not get a turn unless they were aware of the confrontation at the beginning of the round. For example, if the PCs are caught unaware in an ambush, only the GM would take a turn in the first round – PCs would not be allowed to act until the second round, because they were not aware of the confrontation until after the first round started.

On each player's turn, that player plays out a few moments of their PC's actions. They may move their PC to an adjacent zone, and may be prompted by the GM for a single roll. The roll must make narrative sense – a player engaged in a grapple cannot move freely, of course. Furthermore, the GM should take the PC's move into account when gauging the difficulty of the player's roll for the turn. Beheading a zombie may be Ordinary when the characters are situated on level ground, Remarkable as the character charges through the undergrowth, Incredible as the PC climbs their way up a steep cliff, and Legendary if the PC is diving sword-first across a chasm. 
On the GM's turn, the GM moves NPCs and prompts the players for rolls in response to NPC actions taken against them. Each NPC generally prompts a single roll, though this need not strictly be the case. A cerberus may bite with all three of its heads, for example, so the GM would prompt a player to roll three times. Similarly, a dragon surrounded by PCs may lash out with its claws, tail, etc, prompting rolls from multiple players.

Rolls during combat work the same way as rolls outside of combat, with one quick caveat: for each success on a player's turn, or for each failed roll on the GM's turn, the only allowed effects on a PC or an NPC are to inflict a single wound or to make that character unready. That is, a failed roll to defend could result in a wound being inflicted on a PC, or that PC being made unready; a single success on a PC's roll to attack could inflict a wound on an NPC or make them unready; two successes can inflict two wounds on NPCs, wound an NPC and make an NPC unready, or make two NPCs unready; etc. 
Unreadiness is a catchall term to indicate that a PC or NPC is at a momentary disadvantage. Just as inflicting a wound is how the rules show that a character has been hit by a sword or weakened by a poison, unreadiness is how they show that they have been distracted, disarmed, etc. Unreadiness is indicated by turning the unready character's miniature on its side – note that the miniatures of unconscious or dead characters should be removed from the table entirely to avoid ambiguity.  
While unready, a PC or NPC suffers a one-difficulty-step penalty to all rolls. That is, if a PC is knocked prone, Ordinary parries would instead be rolled at Remarkable difficulty (until the PC stands up). Similarly, if a taunt catches an NPC's attention, an attack against them that would normally have required a Incredible roll would be made at Remarkable difficulty instead (until the NPC takes a moment to clear their head). 
A PC or NPC recovers from unreadiness by skipping their turn. That means if an NPC is made unready by a PC, each other PC has a moment to take advantage of the situation before the NPC can recover. NPCs can take advantage of the same opportunity when a PC is made unready, of course; for this reason, being surrounded by multiple enemies is very dangerous!

NONPLAYER CHARACTERS

39
The focus in Bloodlines is on the PCs. As a result, mechanically, NPCs are truly minimal. They are defined entirely by their description and their number of wounds, both of which are set at the discretion of the GM. 
While PC character sheets are visible to everyone, only the GM knows the details of NPCs.  Player knowledge of an NPC is limited to what their PCs know.
Like rolls, NPCs come in four difficulties: Ordinary, Remarkable, Incredible, and Legendary, corresponding to 1, 3, 5, and 7 wounds respectively. An NPC is unconscious when all of their wounds are marked, and killed if they would suffer one more.
The NPC's number of wounds is chosen by the GM to reflect the NPC's size and durability, as well as how interesting the NPC would be during a fight. An adversary who expects to simply trade a few blows back and forth with the PCs should have few wounds, even if it is large, to prevent encounters from becoming repetitive. Conversely, an NPC which is likely to provide a dynamic and engaging combat (or one meant to make the PCs question their choice to fight it) may be given a large number of wounds, even if it's small.



Art.





An NPC's level also serves as a starting point when establishing the difficulty of a roll taken against that NPC – most rolls taken against an Ordinary NPC should be made at Ordinary difficulty, for example. Relatedly, most NPCs should have few wounds. The relative scarcity of high-wound monsters – and the association of important NPCs with difficult rolls – serves to maintain the tension and excitement that they bring.

NPC descriptions are analogous to PC descriptions. Both  illustrate the character's strengths and weaknesses, the circumstances that brought them into the story, and the motivations that guide their ongoing actions. 
The difference between them is how they apply to die rolls. Whereas a PC's description guides the player as they assign their bloodline scores, an NPC's description guides the GM as they assign difficulties to rolls. Clever PCs who take advantage of an NPC's weaknesses may find themselves rolling at difficulties lower than the NPC's level would suggest (for example, making an Ordinary roll against a Remarkable NPC), while careless NPCs may end up rolling at higher difficulties (such as an Incredible roll made against a Remarkably NPC).
Because of the importance of an NPC's description in determining roll difficulties, it's crucial that it focus on details that might be important to the NPC's interaction with PCs. Is the NPC intelligent, or capable of speech? What might motivate it to attack a group of PCs, and how might it go about doing so? What would the PCs be able to learn about this NPC, either from researching it at a library or from speaking to the locals who have dealt with it?
Unlike PC descriptions, NPC descriptions are secret. Players must discover details about the NPC for themselves. 

41
EXAMPLE NPC: BRIGAND
Each brigand is an Ordinary NPC – they have a single wound each. Their description is as follows:
The Rose Canyon is the safest road from Pinecastle to Northmark... or at least it was, until the Steel Hand Sisterhood began raiding caravans just days ago. Survivors recall little more than being ambushed by a volley of poisoned arrows. 
The Sisterhood is a diverse but tight-knit band of outlaws and mercenaries. They are known for driving hard bargains, but have never been known to break a contract once payment has been accepted.
They are currently in the employ of the fearsome Lady Pearlbane. She has hired them to acquire a certain silver-inlaid chest, and send it back – unopened – to her agent in Pinecastle. Gold and captives are the Sisterhood's to keep.
♦	An Ordinary Dwarf roll would be made to attack the brigand with a sword or axe. They fight with malice, but little skill.
♦A Remarkable Orc roll would be made to resist a brigand's attack with a poisoned blade or arrow. This is made instead of (not in addition to) a Dwarf roll to parry or a Goblin roll to dodge – even the tiniest scratch could be deadly! 
♦	An Incredible Merfolk roll would be made to barter with the brigands, convincing them to abandon their mission and join your party.
♦	A Legendary Satyr roll would be made to switch places with a brigand during the scuffle, perhaps grabbing a piece of clothing from a fallen body in order to infiltrate their ranks.

EXAMPLE NPC: CERBERUS
A cerberus is a Remarkable NPC – it has three wounds. Its description is as follows:
The cerberi are twice as large as even the fiercest dog, with three times as many heads. They are known for their obedience and attentiveness; as a result, they make excellent guards. Many ancient treasures lay buried in far corners of the world, forgotten by all except the cerberus that still stands by.
Sneaking past an alert cerberus is near-impossible – each of its many eyes, ears, and noses is sharp. However, it's said that skillfully-played music can lure the beasts into a brief sleep.
This cerebus is named Hammermaw. It has stood vigil at the entry to this cave for centuries, guarding its long-dead master's hoard of gold and gems. 
♦	An Ordinary Satyr roll would be made to lull a cerberus to sleep, provided that the PC was carrying a musical instrument along with them.
♦	A Remarkable Naga roll would be made to identify a particular cerberus from the distinctive markings in its fur, and by extension also deduce the nature of the treasure it guards. 
♦An Incredible Orc roll would be made to forcibly grapple a cerberus to the ground; there are few safe places to grab a beast with so many teeth.
♦	A Legendary Halfling roll would be made to sneak past the cerberus – making it into the cave without being detected by its multitude of eyes, ears, and nostrils. 


Art?

43
EXAMPLE NPC: STEGOSAURUS
Each stegosaurus is an Incredible NPC – they have five wounds each. Their description is as follows:
Stegosauruses are armored lizards with rows of bony plates on their backs and sharp spikes at the end of their tails. Fully grown they stand two armspans tall and five armspans long, though their tiny heads are held just off the ground.
Though nearly unknown in the north, stegosaurus herds are a common sight in the grasslands of the south. They travel in herds of up to a dozen, grazing from dawn until dusk. At night they sleep in a circle with their young in the middle.
Stegosauruses are peaceful herbivores by nature, but dim-witted and easily frightened. When surprised or threatened, they react violently, swinging their tails with surprising force and speed.
♦	An Ordinary Naga roll would be made to identify a stegosaurus, either by sight or from another character's description. It would also give the PC enough information to warn other characters not to surprise the beasts.
♦A Remarkable Elf roll would be made to sooth an agitated stegosaurus with a combination of soft words and slow movements.
♦	An Incredible Dwarf roll would be made to wound a stegosaurus with an arrow. The beasts are large targets, and slow-moving, but their thick hides leave few areas vulnerable to attack.
♦	A Legendary Goblin roll would be made to mount an unsuspecting stegosaurus, and to remain mounted despite its bucking and thrashing.

EXAMPLE NPC: DRAGON
A dragon is a Legendary NPC – it has seven wounds. Its description is as follows:
Dragons are among the most fearsome beasts the world has ever known. They are serpents with leathery wings, barbed tails, and razor-edged claws and teeth. They hatch no larger than cats, but grow continuously throughout their lives, which can be centuries long. Dragons are clever and cruel, but also proud and vain – luckily for humans, two dragons are more likely to kill one another than to work together towards a common goal. 
Even among dragons, Lady Pearlbane is notorious for her obsession with riches. She lays waste to cities and caravans in search of precious metals and gemstones, then uses her fiery breath to smelt her favorite pieces onto herself like armor. The entrance to her lair is scattered with the bones of adventurers who sought to reclaim their stolen treasures.
♦	An Ordinary Elf roll would be made to track the dragon back to its lair. Though the beast flies, leaving no tracks, its home could perhaps be deduced based on local geography and the behavior of nearby animals.
♦A Remarkable Merfolk roll would be made to convince the dragon (through flattery and reverent language) to listen to the PCs... rather than eating them outright and claiming any treasure they may have been carrying. 
♦	An Incredible Halfling roll would be made to surreptitiously steal a trinket during a conversation with the dragon. 
♦	A Legendary Goblin roll would be made while negotiating back and forth with Lady Pearlbane to grab a trinket and run! Perhaps her great bulk – and her surprise at the PC's stupidity –  would slow her down enough for the PC to escape.
