# How to Play

**question: should quotes be used for non-inlined examples? I did so below to try it out.**

Bloodlines is, for the most part, played by talking. The GM describes the situation that the PCs find themselves in. Players ask the GM for details, speak as their PCs, and narrate their actions. The GM explains what happens in response. This pattern continues on, back and forth, scene after scene.

There is no turn order per se. Players participate when they have something to add. That said, the GM should moderate play to ensure that everyone participates. For example, an underparticipating players can be called to action with, "The troll bellows menacingly. Oxyehenhuain, what's your plan?" or "Tor Byorn, what are you up to while she is in the meeting with Ambassador Xictli?"

The GM can interject at any time to call for a roll, in order to judge the outcome of a given action. This chapter addresses how rolls work from the players' perspective, while a more thorough discussion of the GM's role can be found in Chapter 6.

## Rolls

Only players roll dice in Bloodlines. This serves as a constant reminder that the PCs are the story's driving force. They are expected to be proactive, not merely reactive. When dealing with an interaction between multiple NPCs, the GM simply narrates what happens; no rolls are made.

When the GM asks a player for a roll, the player rolls a number of dice equal to their PC's most relevant bloodline score. If it's ambiguous which score is most relevant, the choice falls to the GM.

Each die that shows "1" is a **success**. If no successes are rolled (no dice show "1") then the roll is a **failure**. A failed roll is bad. A single success is good. Additional successes indicate that the action went unexpectedly well, the details of which fall to the GM's discretion.

The size of dice used for the roll is determined by the roll's level. **Minor** rolls use four-sided dice; **Significant** rolls use six-sided dice; **Incredible** rolls use eight-sided dice; **Legendary** rolls use ten-sided dice. Successes are rarer on larger dice, of course; a Significant roll made with six dice will succeed two times out of three, while a Legendary roll made with six dice will succeed less than half the time.

Roll levels are set by the GM, based both on the challenge in front of the PC and their approach to it. Sometimes it's easier to pick the lock, while other times it's easier to kick down the door. Level can also be affected by the player's mindful narration of the PC's actions. Suppose Oxyehenhuain is attempting to pick a lock, which the GM considers a Significant roll. If Oxyehenhuain wants to pick the lock quickly, she may be called to make an Incredible roll instead. If she succeeds, she may be able to catch any NPCs on the other side of the door by surprise. On the other hand, if she wants to take her time, the roll could be Minor. In exchange, the consequences of failure may be more severe: perhaps the door opens into an ambush.

## Failing Forward

**flesh these paragraphs out, obviously.**

No roll should ever result in nothing happening, whether it be a failure or a success.

A failed roll is always bad for the PCs, but should still move the story forward. It should be viewed by the GM an as invitation to introduce some new and unfortunate plot twist.

> Suppose Oxye and Tor Byorn are pursuing some cultists through a cave system. The GM calls for Tor Byorn, who is walking ahead as a scout, for an Elf roll. If it's successful, he hears voices up ahead; if she fails, the two of them are ambushed.

Roll outcomes are immediate.

> Before opening a door, Oxyehenhuain notices that the hinge is connected to a trigger. She attempts to disarm it, prompting a Goblin roll. If she succeeds, she's able to disarm the trap and open the door safely. If she fails, the trap triggers, and the room begins to fill with icy water.

## Confrontations

Broadly, the rules work the same during a fight that they do at any other time. Players participate in whatever order feels natural. The GM interjects on behalf of NPCs, and prompts the PCs for rolls. No roll ever results in nothing happening. The specifics of how these rules are applied during a confrontation bears additional discussion, however.

During a confrontation, players should contribute as they like, within reason, even if not everyone else has gone since their last turn. If some players contribute more than others, it can be presumed that the action is simply moving faster around those PCs! Of course, if the GM deems some players to be participating too little, they may specifically prompt them: "Oxye, a few of the skeletons turn suddenly turn away from the group and charge at you. What do you do?"

The GM calls for rolls at their discretion. This means that a player may sometimes narrate several actions before being called to roll. When this happens, it is the GM that determines which bloodline score should be rolled. For example, suppose that Oxyehenhuain wants to sneak up behind an NPC and knock them out. The GM may choose to call for a Goblin roll (for the sneaking) or for a Dwarf roll (for the attack), depending on which seems more appropriate at the time.

**some polish is missing here**

Each success is worth one wound on an NPC, or an effect of about that size. Each failed roll is worth one wound on a PC, or an effect of about that size. This can be literally anything. Grapples, affecting NPC behavior by taunting/distracting/whatever, etc. A big list can be found in chapter 6. 

## Injury, Recovery, and Death
