# How to Play

Bloodlines is, for the most part, played by talking. The GM describes the situation that the PCs find themselves in. Players ask the GM for details, speak as their PCs, and narrate their actions. The GM explains what happens in response. This pattern continues on, back and forth, scene after scene.

There is no turn order per se. Players participate when they have something to add. That said, the GM may also use pointed prompts to ensure that everyone participates. 

> When confronted with a band of ambushers, the GM finds that Tor Byorn is taking far more turns than Oxyehenhuain. In order to involve Oxye in the action, the GM prompts her directly: "Oxye, a few of them turn suddenly turn away from the group and charge at you. What do you do?"

> Oxyehenhuain tends to take the lead in negotiations with NPCs; sometimes Tor Byorn sits them out entirely. The GM handles this by cutting back and forth between the two PCs while they are apart: "Tor Byorn, what are you up to while she is in the meeting with Ambassador Xictli?"

The GM can interject at any time to call for a roll, in order to judge the outcome of a given action. This chapter addresses how rolls work from the players' perspective, while a more thorough discussion of the GM's role can be found in Chapter 6.

## Rolling Dice

Only players roll dice in Bloodlines. This serves as a constant reminder that the PCs are the story's driving force. They are expected to be proactive, not merely reactive. When dealing with an interaction between multiple NPCs, the GM simply narrates what happens; no rolls are made.

When the GM asks a player for a roll, the player rolls a number of dice equal to their PC's most relevant bloodline score. If it's ambiguous which score is most relevant, the choice falls to the GM.

Each die that shows "1" is a **success**. If no successes are rolled (no dice show "1") then the roll is a **failure**. A failed roll is bad. A single success is good. Additional successes indicate that the action went unexpectedly well, the details of which fall to the GM's discretion.

The size of dice used for the roll is determined by the roll's level. **Ordinary** rolls use four-sided dice, **Significant** rolls use six-sided dice, and **Extraordinary** rolls use eight-sided dice. Successes are rarer on larger dice, of course; an Ordinary roll made with five dice will succeed three times out of four, while a Legendary roll made with five dice will succeed less than half the time. 

> Example of TBY wanting to do something, and how he rolls for it. 

Roll levels are set by the GM, based both on the challenge in front of the PC and their approach to it. Sometimes it's easier to pick the lock, while other times it's easier to kick down the door. Level can also be affected by the player's mindful narration of the PC's actions. 

> Suppose Oxyehenhuain is attempting to pick a lock, which the GM considers Significant. If she states specifically that she is taking her time and picking the pock very carefully, the roll could be Ordinary instead. In that case, the consequences of failure may be more severe: perhaps the door opens into an ambush, or she is caught before getting the door open. 

## Failing Forward

In Bloodlines, the outcome of a roll is never "nothing happens." Each roll advances the story, making it impossible for a player to reattempt the same toll at the same stakes. This ensures that the game's momentum is never stalled out by the results of a roll. 

Traditionally, a failed roll indicates that a PC is simply unsuccessful in their attempted action. In Bloodlines, the GM instead views a failed roll as an invitation to introduce a new and unfortunate plot twist. Often, this twist will subvert the action the PC was attempting... or give them the desired outcome, but at an unexpected cost. This is particularly true when a roll is made to use a power; magic is dangerous and unpredictable, after all, so a PC should never feel that their power is completely under their control. 

> Suppose Oxye and Tor Byorn are pursuing some cultists through a cave system. The GM calls for Tor Byorn, who is walking ahead as a scout, for an Elf roll. If it's successful, he hears hushed voices arguing; if he fails, the two of them are ambushed. 

> Before opening a door, Oxyehenhuain notices that the hinge is connected to a trigger. She attempts to disarm it, prompting a Halfling roll. If she succeeds, she's able to disarm the trap and open the door safely. If she fails, the trap triggers, and the room begins to fill with icy water.

## Confrontations

Broadly, the rules work the same during a fight that they do at any other time. Players participate in whatever order feels natural. The GM interjects on behalf of NPCs, and prompts the PCs for rolls. No roll ever results in nothing happening. The specifics of how these rules are applied during a confrontation bears additional discussion, however.

During a confrontation, players should contribute as they like, within reason, even if not everyone else has gone since their last turn. If some players contribute more than others, it can be presumed that the action is simply moving faster around those PCs! Of course, if the GM deems some players to be participating too little, they may specifically prompt them.

The GM calls for rolls at their discretion. This means that a player may sometimes narrate several actions before being called to roll. When this happens, it is the GM that determines which bloodline score should be rolled. 

> Suppose that Tor Byorn wants to sneak up behind an NPC and knock them out. The GM may choose to call for a Halfling roll (for the sneaking) or for a Dwarf roll (for the attack), depending on which seems more appropriate at the time.......... wait, aren't these both halfling rolls now?

Generally speaking, each success is worth a single condition box, as is each failure. During a confrontation, a player whose roll shows two successes should expect to mark two NPC boxes, and one whose roll shows a failure (that is, no successes) should expect a PC box to be checked. Other effects are allowed as well, of course; PCs can grapple, taunt, interact with the environment, and so on. Their actions can affect NPC behavior, bring new information to light, or influence the GM's assessment of the levels of future rolls. No matter what's being rolled for, however, the GM should judge the roll's effect to be roughly on par with one box marked per success. 

> example: TBY taunts baddies away from Oxye. fails. there's someone behind you! they leave Oxye alone, but now surround you. 

> Example: Oxye rolls to deduce why these guys might be here. success. 

> example: TBY rolls to kick some ass. two successes. two baddies drop. 

> example: Oxye rolls to peg one with a stone. failure. Hits TBY. 

## Injury, Recovery, and Death

*these boxes were introduced in the previous chapter, but we need to explain here how they actually work with the rules.*

*Corresponding to each bloodline score is a checkbox.*

+ *Dwarf -> Broken*
+ *Elf -> Dazed*
+ *Halfling -> Shaken*

*Whenever a PC gets hit, they check a box. The GM will tell them which one, either by deciding or by choosing randomly.*

> let's have two examples in this section. I'm not sure exactly where they go. 

*Wounds are recovered in dramatically appropriate time. A short rest immediately after the confrontation is sufficient to unmark a single wound (of the player's choice). All wounds are unmarked after a long rest, such as a hot meal or a night of sleep somewhere safe.*

*Whenever a player is called to make a roll, if their corresponding box is checked, they instead make that roll one level higher. For example, if Tor Byorn is Broken and the GM calls for a Significant Dwarf roll, an Incredible roll must be made instead.*

*Two of the boxes indicate mental detriments due to physical damage. Why? Well, pain is distracting. Concussions impair mental and social ability. Battles are disorienting and panic-inducing, particularly for the inexperienced.*

*If a player would check a box but all four are already checked, they are killed. This means you are on your feet, though at an ever-diminishing capacity, until the deathblow is struck. You never lay on the ground waiting to die.*
