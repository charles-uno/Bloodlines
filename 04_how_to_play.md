# How to Play

Bloodlines is, for the most part, played by talking. The GM describes the situation that the PCs find themselves in. Players ask the GM for details, speak as their PCs, and narrate their actions. The GM explains what happens in response. This pattern continues on, back and forth, scene after scene.

There is no turn order per se. Players participate when they have something to add. That said, the GM should moderate play to ensure that everyone participates. For example, an underparticipating players can be called to action with, "The troll bellows menacingly. Oxyehenhuain, what's your plan?" or "Tor Byorn, what are you up to while she is in the meeting with Ambassador Xictli?"

> Is that last bit actually an example? Can we phrase it like one? 

The GM can interject at any time to call for a roll, in order to judge the outcome of a given action. This chapter addresses how rolls work from the players' perspective, while a more thorough discussion of the GM's role can be found in Chapter 6.

## Rolling Dice

Only players roll dice in Bloodlines. This serves as a constant reminder that the PCs are the story's driving force. They are expected to be proactive, not merely reactive. When dealing with an interaction between multiple NPCs, the GM simply narrates what happens; no rolls are made.

When the GM asks a player for a roll, the player rolls a number of dice equal to their PC's most relevant bloodline score. If it's ambiguous which score is most relevant, the choice falls to the GM.

Each die that shows "1" is a **success**. If no successes are rolled (no dice show "1") then the roll is a **failure**. A failed roll is bad. A single success is good. Additional successes indicate that the action went unexpectedly well, the details of which fall to the GM's discretion.

The size of dice used for the roll is determined by the roll's level. **Minor** rolls use four-sided dice; **Significant** rolls use six-sided dice; **Incredible** rolls use eight-sided dice; **Legendary** rolls use ten-sided dice. Successes are rarer on larger dice, of course; a Significant roll made with six dice will succeed two times out of three, while a Legendary roll made with six dice will succeed less than half the time. 

> Example of TBY wanting to do something, and how he rolls for it. 

Roll levels are set by the GM, based both on the challenge in front of the PC and their approach to it. Sometimes it's easier to pick the lock, while other times it's easier to kick down the door. Level can also be affected by the player's mindful narration of the PC's actions. 

> Suppose Oxyehenhuain is attempting to pick a lock, which the GM considers a Significant roll. If she states specifically that she is taking her time and picking the pock very carefully, the roll could be Minor instead. In that case, the consequences of failure may be more severe: perhaps the door opens into an ambush, or she is caught before getting the door open. 

## Failing Forward

*No roll should ever result in nothing happening, whether it be a failure or a success. every roll should advance the story, making it impossible to try the same roll again at the same stakes.*

*A failed roll is always bad for the PCs, but should still move the story forward. It should be viewed by the GM an as invitation to introduce some new and interesting/unfortunate plot twist.*

> Suppose Oxye and Tor Byorn are pursuing some cultists through a cave system. The GM calls for Tor Byorn, who is walking ahead as a scout, for an Elf roll. If it's successful, he hears hushed voices arguing; if he fails, the two of them are ambushed. 

*Roll outcomes are immediate.*

> Before opening a door, Oxyehenhuain notices that the hinge is connected to a trigger. She attempts to disarm it, prompting a Goblin roll. If she succeeds, she's able to disarm the trap and open the door safely. If she fails, the trap triggers, and the room begins to fill with icy water.

## Confrontations

Broadly, the rules work the same during a fight that they do at any other time. Players participate in whatever order feels natural. The GM interjects on behalf of NPCs, and prompts the PCs for rolls. No roll ever results in nothing happening. The specifics of how these rules are applied during a confrontation bears additional discussion, however.

During a confrontation, players should contribute as they like, within reason, even if not everyone else has gone since their last turn. If some players contribute more than others, it can be presumed that the action is simply moving faster around those PCs! Of course, if the GM deems some players to be participating too little, they may specifically prompt them.

> When confronted with a band of ambushers, the GM finds that Tor Byorn is taking far more turns than Oxyehenhuain. In order to involve Oxye in the action, the GM prompts her directly: "Oxye, a few of the skeletons turn suddenly turn away from the group and charge at you. What do you do?"

The GM calls for rolls at their discretion. This means that a player may sometimes narrate several actions before being called to roll. When this happens, it is the GM that determines which bloodline score should be rolled. 

> Suppose that Tor Byorn wants to sneak up behind an NPC and knock them out. The GM may choose to call for a Goblin roll (for the sneaking) or for a Dwarf roll (for the attack), depending on which seems more appropriate at the time.

*Each success is worth one wound on an NPC, or an effect of about that size. Each failed roll is worth one wound on a PC, or an effect of about that size. This can be literally anything. Grapples, affecting NPC behavior by taunting/distracting/whatever, etc. A big list can be found in chapter 6.*

## Injury, Recovery, and Death

*these boxes were introduced in the previous chapter, but we need to explain here how they actually work with the rules.*

*Corresponding to each bloodline score is a checkbox.*

+ *Dwarf -> Broken*
+ *Elf -> Dazed (this word may later be replaced)*
+ *Goblin -> Unsteady*
+ *Halfling -> Shaken*

*Whenever a PC gets hit, they check a box. The GM will tell them which one, either by deciding or by choosing randomly.*

> let's have two examples in this section. I'm not sure exactly where they go. 

*Wounds are recovered in dramatically appropriate time. A short rest immediately after the confrontation is sufficient to unmark a single wound (of the player's choice). All wounds are unmarked after a long rest, such as a hot meal or a night of sleep somewhere safe.*

*Whenever a player is called to make a roll, if their corresponding box is checked, they instead make that roll one level higher. For example, if Tor Byorn is Broken and the GM calls for a Significant Dwarf roll, an Incredible roll must be made instead.*

*Two of the boxes indicate mental detriments due to physical damage. Why? Well, pain is distracting. Concussions impair mental and social ability. Battles are disorienting and panic-inducing, particularly for the inexperienced.*

*If a player would check a box but all four are already checked, they are killed. This means you are on your feet, though at an ever-diminishing capacity, until the deathblow is struck. You never lay on the ground waiting to die.*
