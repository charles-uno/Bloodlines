# How to Play

Bloodlines is, for the most part, played by talking. The GM describes the situation that the PCs find themselves in. Players ask the GM for details, speak as their PCs, and narrate their actions. The GM explains what happens in response. This pattern continues on, back and forth, scene after scene.

There is no turn order per se. Players participate when they have something to add. That said, the GM may also use pointed prompts to ensure that everyone participates. 

> When confronted with a band of ambushers, the GM finds that Tor Byorn is taking far more turns than Oxyehenhuain. In order to involve Oxye in the action, the GM prompts her directly: "Oxye, a few of them turn suddenly turn away from the group and charge at you. What do you do?"

> Oxyehenhuain tends to take the lead in negotiations with NPCs; sometimes Tor Byorn sits them out entirely. The GM handles this by cutting back and forth between the two PCs while they are apart: "Tor Byorn, what are you up to while she is in the meeting with Ambassador Xictli?"

The GM can interject at any time to call for a roll, in order to judge the outcome of a given action. This chapter addresses how rolls work from the players' perspective, while a more thorough discussion of the GM's role can be found in Chapter 6.

## Rolling Dice

Only players roll dice in Bloodlines. This serves as a constant reminder that the PCs are the story's driving force. They are expected to be proactive, not merely reactive. When dealing with an interaction between multiple NPCs, the GM simply narrates what happens; no rolls are made.

When the GM asks a player for a roll, the player rolls a number of dice equal to their PC's most relevant bloodline score. If it's ambiguous which score is most relevant, the choice falls to the GM.

Each die that shows "1" is a **success**. If no successes are rolled (no dice show "1") then the roll is a **failure**. A failed roll is bad. A single success is good. Additional successes indicate that the action went unexpectedly well, the details of which fall to the GM's discretion.

The size of dice used for the roll is determined by the roll's level. **Ordinary** rolls use four-sided dice, **Significant** rolls use six-sided dice, and **Extraordinary** rolls use eight-sided dice. Successes are rarer on larger dice, of course; an Ordinary roll made with five dice will succeed three times out of four, while a Legendary roll made with five dice will succeed less than half the time. 

> When confronted with a locked door, Tor Byorn's solution is to kick it down. To judge the result, the GM calls for an Ordinary Dwarf roll. Tor Byorn's Dwarf score is 7, so he rolls 7 four-sided dice. The result is 2, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1: a success. The GM narrates that the door buckles, showering both Tor Byorn and Oxyehenhuain with rotten wood. 

Roll levels are set by the GM, based both on the challenge in front of the PC and their approach to it. Sometimes it's easier to pick the lock, while other times it's easier to kick down the door. Level can also be affected by the player's mindful narration of the PC's actions. 

> Oxye is attempting to pick a lock. Because she is under no time constraints, O indicates Oxye's intention to work slowly and methodically. The GM calls for a Significant Halfling roll to judge the outcome. 

> Oxye is attempting to pick the same lock. Because there are guards just around the corner, Oxye must work quickly and quietly. The GM calls for an Extraordinary Halfling roll to judge the outcome. 

## Failing Forward

In Bloodlines, the outcome of a roll is never "nothing happens." Each roll advances the story, making it impossible for a player to reattempt the same toll at the same stakes. This ensures that the game's momentum is never stalled out by the results of a roll. 

Traditionally, a failed roll indicates that a PC is simply unsuccessful in their attempted action. In Bloodlines, the GM instead views a failed roll as an invitation to introduce a new and unfortunate plot twist. Often, this twist will subvert the action the PC was attempting... or give them the desired outcome, but at an unexpected cost. This is particularly true when a roll is made to use a power; magic is dangerous and unpredictable, after all, so a PC should never feel that their power is completely under their control. 

> Suppose Oxye and Tor Byorn are pursuing some cultists through a cave system. The GM calls for Tor Byorn, who is walking ahead as a scout, for an Elf roll. If it's successful, he hears hushed voices arguing; if he fails, the two of them are ambushed. 

> Before opening a door, Oxyehenhuain notices that the hinge is connected to a trigger. She attempts to disarm it, prompting a Halfling roll. If she succeeds, she's able to disarm the trap and open the door safely. If she fails, the trap triggers, and the room begins to fill with icy water.

## Injury, Recovery, and Death

As mentioned in the previous chapter, a PC's health is tracked using three condition boxes, each of which corresponds to one of the bloodline scores:

+ The **Broken** box corresponds to the Dwarf bloodline score.
+ The **Dazed** box corresponds to the Elf bloodline score.
+ The **Shaken** box corresponds to the Halfling bloodline score.

The GM will call for a box to be marked when the PC fails a roll, and as a result is subjected to physical punishment. This can mean being hit by an arrow or sword, mauled by a monster, sickened by poison, swept up by a landslide, overcome by fatigue, and so on.

Whenever the GM calls on a player to make a roll, if the box corresponding to that roll is marked, the roll must instead be made at the next higher level. Note that physical punishment makes a PC's mental and social rolls more difficult, not just their physical rolls; even polite conversation can be made problematic by blood loss, a concussion, or shock!

> During a fight, Tor Byorn attacks an NPC with his sword, for which the GM prompts an Ordinary Dwarf roll. However, since Tor Byorn's Broken box is checked, he must make a Significant roll instead.

Condition boxes are unmarked in dramatically appropriate time. A short rest immediately after the confrontation is sufficient to unmark a single box of the player's choice. This could be as simple as sitting down, having a drink of water, and binding a wound or two. All of a PC's boxes are unmarked after a long rest, such as a hot meal or a night of sleep somewhere safe.

> After stumbling upon a nest of fire wasps, Oxye's Dazed box is marked. However, stopping to rest seems risky. She and Tor Byorn choose to push forward. As a result, her Dazed box will not be unmarked until they make camp for the night.

When a PC is called to mark a condition box but they have none left (that is, if they suffer an injury when they have three boxes already marked), they are killed. PCs in Bloodlines never lay bleeding on the ground, waiting to die. They are standing, albeit unsteadily, until their last breath.

## Confrontations

Broadly, the rules work the same during a fight that they do at any other time. Players participate in whatever order feels natural. The GM interjects on behalf of NPCs, and prompts the PCs for rolls. No roll ever results in nothing happening. The specifics of how these rules are applied during a confrontation bears additional discussion, however.

During a confrontation, players should contribute as they like, within reason, even if not everyone else has gone since their last turn. If some players contribute more than others, it can be presumed that the action is simply moving faster around those PCs! Of course, if the GM deems some players to be participating too little, they may specifically prompt them.

The GM calls for rolls at their discretion. This means that a player may sometimes narrate several actions before being called to roll. When this happens, it is the GM that determines which bloodline score should be rolled. 

> Tor Byorn is attempting to push a boulder over a ledge, without being seen by the NPCs below. The GM may choose to call for a Dwarf roll (for the push) or a Halfling roll (for the stealth), depending on which seems more appropriate at the time. 

Generally speaking, each success is worth a single condition box, as is each failure. During a confrontation, a player whose roll shows two successes should expect to mark two NPC boxes, and one whose roll shows a failure (that is, no successes) should expect a PC box to be checked. Other effects are allowed as well, of course; PCs can grapple, taunt, interact with the environment, and so on. Their actions can affect NPC behavior, bring new information to light, or influence the GM's assessment of the levels of future rolls. No matter what's being rolled for, however, the GM should judge the roll's effect to be roughly on par with one box marked per success. 

> example. oxye is out front. elf roll to detect baddies.  if success, she hears them. if failure, ambush. just two ambushers? 

> example: TBY taunts baddies away from Oxye. if success, they turn towards him. if failure, there's another one behind him and he gets hit. 

> example: Oxye rolls to peg one with a stone. if success, she hits one. If failure, she hits TBY. 

> example: TBY rolls to kick some ass. success, he grabs one to allow negotiations. failure, they chop him up. 

> why haven't we got any examples with grappling or something? I want to show how rolls can do something other than damage, and influence NPC behavior and the difficulty of later rolls.
