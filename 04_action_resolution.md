# Action resolution

(This chapter is a mess. I'm working on it. -Charles)

The success and failure of PC actions are judged by die rolls. The following rules lay out when and how to do so.

**The PCs are expected to be the driving force behind the story. They should be active, not reactive. That's why only players roll.**

**Only roll when there are two interesting options. Examples of interesting failures:**
- **cultists in the sewer. who sees who first?**
- **disarming a trap. do you trip it?**
- **trying to talk past a guard. he might yell for backup**

**Failure is bad for the PCs but still good for the story.**

**auto-success is great, should be common**

**auto-fail is not great, is allowed, but should be rare.**

**Story trumps realism**

**let it ride**

**negative consequences happen right away. they never hang over you and give you and give you a chance to metagame**

## Rolls

When the GM calls for a roll, the player rolls a number of dice equal to their PC's most relevant bloodline score. If it's ambiguous which score is most relevant, the determination falls to the GM. Note that when casting a spell, the bloodline used for the roll is always the one that corresponds to the spell.

Each die that shows "1" is a **success**. If no successes are rolled (no dice show "1") then the roll is a **failure**. When a player rolls a single success, it means that their PC's action had more or less the result they intended. Additional successes indicate that the action went unexpectedly well, the details of which are left to the GM's imagination. On the other hand, a failed roll is always bad for the PCs, though of course it should still eb good for the story; the previous section discussed this idea in some detail, and the upcoming section addresses how it pertains specifically to confrontations.

Each roll has a level, which is set by the GM. A roll's level dictates the size of dice used, and, correspondingly, the roll's likeliness of success. **Minor** rolls use four-sided dice; **Significant** rolls use six-sided dice; **Incredible** rolls use eight-sided dice; **Legendary** rolls use ten-sided dice. It's recommended that Significant rolls be the most common, and that Legendary rolls be reserved for the truly outrageous, in order to maintain the tension and excitement that come with the ten-sided dice.

The level of a roll depends on the challenge in front of a PC as well as how they approach it. Sometimes it's easier to pick the lock, while other times it's easier to kick down the door. The GM should also take the PC's description into account. For example, a ranger and a scholar may have the same Elf score (and thus the same innate perceptiveness), but **how do I justify this without telling players to write "expert at fighting with all weapons always" on every sheet?**

A player can also influence roll level through mindful narration of their PC's actions. For example, if a PC wants to pick a lock quickly, they may be called to roll at a higher level (since the action is more difficult). The tradeoff is that any NPCs on the other side of the door will likely be caught by surprise if the PC is successful. Conversely, a player may be allowed to roll an attack at a lower difficulty if they describe their PC's berserk fervor, as the attack is more likely to inflict wounds on NPCs. However, such an onslaught might also convince the NPCs that they'd be better off ganging up on a more vulnerable PC.

## Confrontations

Action resolution during a confrontation is fundamentally no different from action resolution at any other time. However, the details merit additional discussion.

**one success means one wound on an NPC**

**one failure means one wound on a PC**

**There are other effects, of course: disarm, grapple, distract, cast spell, interact with environment**

**play is conversational. no set order. GM does not take turns per se, but may prompt underparticipating players: "so-and-so is coming at you -- what do you do?" GM can interject, exposit, even call for rolls.**

**Rolls follow fiction. If you have 4 PCs yelling at an NPC, it's not a social confrontation. That NPC is going to bail or call the guards!**

**PCs are expected to be the driving force. Take impetus. Set the pace. **

**Examples of failures:**
- **try to climb on the troll? it slams you into the wall.**
- **try to take pot shots into combat? maybe you miss and hit your friend**
- **in a social confrontation, you misspeak, insult someone important, get flustered**

**time and space are nebulous. "you're a little bit too far" is a lame reason to disallow something cool**





**The story drives the mechanics, not vice versa.** Time and space are not strictly defined. There is no turn order. Players should just keep playing, even if a confrontation is happening! 

**Only players roll dice.** PCs are expected to act, not react. The responsibility to advance the story falls to them. Furthermore, having players roll gives them some ownership of the ills that befall their PCs, as opposed to feeling that the unfortunate circumstances have been inflicted upon them.

**Rolls are appropriate only when an attempted action could result in multiple interesting outcomes.** Like any other roll, a roll in combat never results in nothing happening. A failed attack with a sword may mean that the PC's opponent ducked under the blade and landed a blow of their own. A failed roll to pick off an NPC from a distance may mean the arrow missed, but still drew attention to the hiding spot. 

**The outcomes of rolls should be important, but not too important.** As a rule, a PC inflicts one wound for each success they roll during a confrontation, and they suffer one wound for a failed roll. This is meant to give an idea for the magnitude of appropriate roll outcomes, not to imply that every roll should cause wounds. Grappling, kicking over a table to create a barriacade, sneaking out of the fray, creating a distraction, and countless other actions can be taken in combat to affect the behaviors of NPCs and the levels of future rolls!
