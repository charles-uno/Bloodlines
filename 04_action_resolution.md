# Action resolution

(This chapter is a mess. I'm working on it. -Charles)

The success and failure of PC actions are judged by die rolls. The following rules lay out when and how to do so.

**The story drives the mechanics, not vice versa.**

**Only players roll dice.** 

**Rolls are appropriate only when an attempted action could result in multiple interesting outcomes.**

**The outcomes of rolls should be important, but not too important.** 

## Rolls

When the GM calls for a roll, the player rolls a number of dice equal to their PC's most relevant bloodline score. If it's ambiguous which score is most relevant, the determination falls to the GM. Note that when casting a spell, the bloodline used for the roll is always the one that corresponds to the spell.

Each die that shows "1" is a **success**. If no successes are rolled (no dice show "1") then the roll is a **failure**. When a player rolls a single success, it means that their PC's action had more or less the result they intended. Additional successes indicate that the action went unexpectedly well, the details of which are left to the GM's imagination. On the other hand, a failed roll is always bad for the PCs, though of course it should still eb good for the story; the previous section discussed this idea in some detail, and the upcoming section addresses how it pertains specifically to confrontations.

Each roll has a level, which is set by the GM. A roll's level dictates the size of dice used, and, correspondingly, the roll's likeliness of success. **Minor** rolls use four-sided dice; **Significant** rolls use six-sided dice; **Incredible** rolls use eight-sided dice; **Legendary** rolls use ten-sided dice. It's recommended that Significant rolls be the most common, and that Legendary rolls be reserved for the truly outrageous, in order to maintain the tension and excitement that come with the ten-sided dice.

**In progress...**

**The number of dice rolled is equal to the PC's most relevant bloodline score.** When rolling as part of a spell, the relevant bloodline score is the one associated with the spell. If it is ever unclear which bloodline is most relevant to an action, the decision falls to the GM.

**Each "1" rolled is a success; if no successes are rolled, the roll is failed.** A single success generally means that the player got more or less what they were hoping for. Additional successes mean that an action went unexpectedly well, the details of which fall to the GM's discretion. Failed rolls are bad for the PCs. As much as possible, a failed roll should not mean that a PC simply didn't do what they were attempting; failed rolls should be viewed by the GM as an invitation to introduce new and unfortunate plot twists into the story. 

**The size of die rolled is determined by the GM, as a holistic assessment of the action's difficulty.** Rolls come in four levels, **Minor**, **Significant**, **Incredible**, and **Legendary**, which are rolled on four-, six-, eight-, and ten-sided dice respectively. The level of a roll depends on the challenge in front of a PC as well as their approach to it; sometimes it's easier to pick the lock, while other times it's easier to kick down the door. 

**Players can influence the level of rolls they are confronted with through mindful narration of their PCs' actions.** For example, if a PC wants to pick a lock quickly, they may be called to roll at a higher level (since the action is more difficult). The tradeoff is that any NPCs on the other side of the door will likely be caught by surprise if the PC is successful. Conversely, a player may be allowed to roll an attack at a lower difficulty if they describe their PC's berserk fervor. The attack is more likely to inflict wounds on NPCs. However, such an onslaught might also convince the NPCs that they'd be better off ganging up on a squishier PC.

## Confrontations

Action resolution during a confrontation is fundamentally no different from action resolution at any other time. However, the details merit additional discussion.

**The story drives the mechanics, not vice versa.** Time and space are not strictly defined. There is no turn order. Players should just keep playing, even if a confrontation is happening! 

**Only players roll dice.** PCs are expected to act, not react. The responsibility to advance the story falls to them. Furthermore, having players roll gives them some ownership of the ills that befall their PCs, as opposed to feeling that the unfortunate circumstances have been inflicted upon them.

**Rolls are appropriate only when an attempted action could result in multiple interesting outcomes.** Like any other roll, a roll in combat never results in nothing happening. A failed attack with a sword may mean that the PC's opponent ducked under the blade and landed a blow of their own. A failed roll to pick off an NPC from a distance may mean the arrow missed, but still drew attention to the hiding spot. 

**The outcomes of rolls should be important, but not too important.** As a rule, a PC inflicts one wound for each success they roll during a confrontation, and they suffer one wound for a failed roll. This is meant to give an idea for the magnitude of appropriate roll outcomes, not to imply that every roll should cause wounds. Grappling, kicking over a table to create a barriacade, sneaking out of the fray, creating a distraction, and countless other actions can be taken in combat to affect the behaviors of NPCs and the levels of future rolls!
