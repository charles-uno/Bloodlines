# Nonplayer Characters

The focus in Bloodlines is on the PCs. As a result, mechanically, NPCs are
truly minimal. They are defined entirely by their description and their number
of wounds, both of which are set at the discretion of the GM.

While PC character sheets are visible to everyone, only the GM knows the
details of NPCs. Player knowledge of an NPC is limited to what their PCs
know.

---

Like rolls, NPCs come in four levels: **Minor**, **Significant**,
**Incredible**, and **Legendary**, corresponding to **1**, **3**, **5**, and
**7** wounds respectively. An NPC is defeated if all of their wounds are
marked.

The NPC's number of wounds is chosen by the GM to reflect the NPC's size and
durability, as well as how interesting the NPC would be during a fight.  An
adversary who expects to simply trade a few blows back and forth with the PCs
should have few wounds, even if it is large, to prevent encounters from
becoming repetitive. Conversely, an NPC which is likely to provide a dynamic
and engaging confrontation (or one meant to make the PCs question their choice to
fight it) may be given a large number of wounds, even if it's small.

An NPC's level also serves as a starting point when establishing the
level of a roll taken against that NPC – most rolls taken against a
Significant NPC should be Significant, for example.  Relatedly,
most NPCs should have few wounds. The relative scarcity of Legendary monsters
– and the association of Legendary NPCs with Legendary rolls – serves to
maintain the tension and excitement that they bring.

NPC **descriptions** are analogous to PC descriptions. Both illustrate the
character's strengths and weaknesses, the circumstances that brought them into
the story, and the motivations that guide their ongoing actions.

The difference between them is how they apply to die rolls. Whereas a PC's
description guides the player as they assign their bloodline scores, an NPC's
description guides the GM as they assign levels to rolls. Clever PCs who
take advantage of an NPC's weaknesses may find themselves rolling at
levels lower than the NPC's level would suggest (for example, making a Minor roll against a Significant NPC), while careless NPCs may end up
rolling at higher levels (such as an Incredible roll made against a
Significant NPC).

Because of the importance of an NPC's description in determining roll
levels, it's crucial that it focus on details that might be important to
the NPC's interaction with PCs. Is the NPC intelligent, or capable of speech?
What might motivate it to attack a group of PCs, and how might it go about
doing so? What would the PCs be able to learn about this NPC, either from
researching it at a library or from speaking to the locals who have dealt with
it?

## Example NPC: Brigand

(Updated to here. The example rolls should just need to be reverted to what they were when we had four attributes, I think. -Charles)

Each brigand is an Ordinary NPC – they have a single wound each. Their
description is as follows:

> The Rose Canyon is the safest road from Pinecastle to Northmark... or at
> least it was, until the Steel Hand Sisterhood began raiding caravans just
> days ago. Survivors recall little more than being ambushed by a volley of
> poisoned arrows.
>
> The Sisterhood is a diverse but tight-knit band of outlaws and mercenaries.
> They are known for driving hard bargains, but have never been known to break
> a contract once payment has been accepted.
>
> They are currently in the employ of the fearsome Lady Pearlbane. She has
> hired them to acquire a certain silver-inlaid chest, and send it back –
> unopened – to her agent in Pinecastle. Gold and captives are the
> Sisterhood's to keep.

-   An Ordinary Dwarf roll would be made to attack the brigand with a sword or
    axe. They fight with malice, but little skill.
-   A Remarkable Orc roll would be made to resist a brigand's attack with a
    poisoned blade or arrow. This is made instead of (not in addition to) a
    Dwarf roll to parry or a Goblin roll to dodge – even the tiniest scratch
    could be deadly!
-   An Incredible Merfolk roll would be made to barter with the brigands,
    convincing them to abandon their mission and join your party.
-   A Legendary Satyr roll would be made to switch places with a brigand
    during  the scuffle, perhaps grabbing a piece of clothing from a fallen
    body in  order to infiltrate their ranks.

## Example NPC: Cerberus

A cerberus is a Remarkable NPC – it has three wounds. Its description is as
follows:

> The cerberi are twice as large as even the fiercest dog, with three times as
> many heads. They are known for their obedience and attentiveness; as a
> result, they make excellent guards. Many ancient treasures lay buried in far
> corners of the world, forgotten by all except the cerberus that still stands
> by.
>
> Sneaking past an alert cerberus is near-impossible – each of its many eyes,
> ears, and noses is sharp. However, it's said that skillfully-played music
> can lure the beasts into a brief sleep.
>
> This cerebus is named Hammermaw. It has stood vigil at the entry to this
> cave for centuries, guarding its long-dead master's hoard of gold and gems.

-   An Ordinary Satyr roll would be made to lull a cerberus to sleep, provided
    that the PC was carrying a musical instrument along with them.
-   A Remarkable Naga roll would be made to identify a particular cerberus
    from  the distinctive markings in its fur, and by extension also deduce
    the nature  of the treasure it guards.
-   An Incredible Orc roll would be made to forcibly grapple a cerberus to the
    ground; there are few safe places to grab a beast with so many teeth.
-   A Legendary Halfling roll would be made to sneak past the cerberus –
    making  it into the cave without being detected by its multitude of eyes,
    ears, and  nostrils.

## Example NPC: Stegosaurus

Each stegosaurus is an Incredible NPC – they have five wounds each.  Their
description is as follows:

> Stegosauruses are armored lizards with rows of bony plates on their backs
> and sharp spikes at the end of their tails. Fully grown they stand two
> armspans tall and five armspans long, though their tiny heads are held just
> off the ground.
>
> Though nearly unknown in the north, stegosaurus herds are a common sight in
> the grasslands of the south. They travel in herds of up to a dozen, grazing
> from dawn until dusk. At night they sleep in a circle with their young in
> the middle.
>
> Stegosauruses are peaceful herbivores by nature, but dim-witted and easily
> frightened. When surprised or threatened, they react violently, swinging
> their tails with surprising force and speed.

-   An Ordinary Naga roll would be made to identify a stegosaurus, either by
    sight or from another character's description. It would also give the PC
    enough information to warn other characters not to surprise the beasts.
-   A Remarkable Elf roll would be made to sooth an agitated stegosaurus with
    a  combination of soft words and slow movements.
-   An Incredible Dwarf roll would be made to wound a stegosaurus with an
    arrow.  The beasts are large targets, and slow-moving, but their thick
    hides leave  few areas vulnerable to attack.
-   A Legendary Goblin roll would be made to mount an unsuspecting
    stegosaurus,  and to remain mounted despite its bucking and thrashing.

## Example NPC: Dragon

A dragon is a Legendary NPC – it has seven wounds. Its description is as
follows:

> Dragons are among the most fearsome beasts the world has ever known.  They
> are serpents with leathery wings, barbed tails, and razor-edged claws and
> teeth. They hatch no larger than cats, but grow continuously throughout
> their lives, which can be centuries long. Dragons are clever and cruel, but
> also proud and vain – luckily for humans, two dragons are more likely to
> kill one another than to work together towards a common goal.
>
> Even among dragons, Lady Pearlbane is notorious for her obsession with
> riches. She lays waste to cities and caravans in search of precious metals
> and gemstones, then uses her fiery breath to smelt her favorite pieces onto
> herself like armor. The entrance to her lair is scattered with the bones of
> adventurers who sought to reclaim their stolen treasures.

-   An Ordinary Elf roll would be made to track the dragon back to its lair.
    Though the beast flies, leaving no tracks, its home could perhaps be
    deduced  based on local geography and the behavior of nearby animals.
-   A Remarkable Merfolk roll would be made to convince the dragon (through
    flattery and reverent language) to listen to the PCs... rather than eating
    them outright and claiming any treasure they may have been carrying.
-   An Incredible Halfling roll would be made to surreptitiously steal a
    trinket  during a conversation with the dragon.
-   A Legendary Goblin roll would be made while negotiating back and forth
    with  Lady Pearlbane to grab a trinket and run! Perhaps her great bulk –
    and her  surprise at the PC's stupidity – would slow her down enough for
    the PC to  escaps.
