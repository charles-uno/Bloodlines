**Probably a little intro here.**

## Father Liam

Father Liam is described as follows:

> Father William "Liam" Ingebert Sweetleaf is the former headmaster of Madam
> Dolores's Orphanage in Threebridges. A trickster by nature, he was run out
> of the orphanage (and the town) after Madam Dolores herself discovered that
> he was training the children to be pickpockets.
>
> Since then, Father Liam has traveled the countryside surviving on his wits
> and ability to deceive. When entering a new community, he often creates a
> new persona and a disguise to go with it, using them to con people out of
> their possessions until he is – inevitably – discovered and run out of town
> again. He is currently traveling disguised as a priest and apothecary, ready to dispense his particular brand of aid to those in need.

Father Liam takes +3 to his Halfling bloodline to account for his deceptive nature and his penchant for false identities. He also takes +1 to his Goblin bloodline – he was once a street-wise scoundrel,
after all. In exchange, he takes -1 to his Elf bloodline and -3 to his Dwarf bloodline. His intelligence is more social than academic, and he has never done an honest day of work in his life! His final bloodline scores are, then, Dwarf 2, Elf 4, Goblin 6, and Halfling 8. 

Before the first play session, Father Liam increments his Dwarf score, bringing it to 3. He always gets a bit soft when he stays in one place for too long, but having an entire town turn on him is the perfect way to get the blood flowing again.

## Galadhel

Galadhel is described as follows:

> Galadhel was born a bastard in the tiny village of Dragbor. Her mother
> always told her that she had Elven blood coursing through her veins, but
> Galadhel believed that this was a lie told to her to hide her father's
> identity and her mother's shame.
>
> She was a rambunctious child who took quickly to the bow and ran wild with
> the forest creatures. She clashed constantly with the elders of her village,
> as in Dragbor the authoritarian council prescribed the path of everyone's
> life from birth to death.

> When they told her she must settle down to be a seamstress like her mother,
Galadhel instead fled to the woods around her village. With her new found freedom, she
decided to track down her absent father and join him in whatever adventures he
must be having. 

Galadhel takes +2 to her Elf bloodline to demonstrate her natural affinity for
the woods and woodland creatures. She also takes +2 to her Goblin bloodline to
explain her skill with a bow. In exchange, she takes -2 each to her Dwarf and Halfling bloodlines. Despite her hot temper and contempt for authority, she prefers to avoid hand-to-hand confrontations. Her final bloodline scores are, then, Dwarf 3, Elf 7, Goblin 7, and Halfling 3. 

Before the first play session, Galadhel takes the Animal Bond spell. Her time in the wilderness awakened the primal connection locked in her Elvish blood. 

## Oxyehenhuain

Oxyehenhuain is described as follows:

> Oxyehenhuain was born in a large city along the edge of a wide waterway.
> Brought up under a strict caste structure, Oxye was selected at an early age
> to be trained as a diplomat and scholar. She excelled at both tasks,
> memorizing mountains of scrolls while learning nearly every language spoken
> on the continent.
>
> Oxye's life of quiet study was interrupted when an ill omen – a red comet –
> appeared in the night sky. Sensing that a massive change in the world was
> nigh, Oxye decided to venture out to discover what was wrong firsthand. With
> no experience of the outside world save for what she had read in ancient
> texts, Oxye crammed as many scrolls as would fit in her bag and headed out
> into the great wide world.

Oxyehenhuain takes +3 to her Elf bloodline and +1 to her Halfling bloodline. She is well-mannered and patient, with an extensive knowledge of the history and languages of the world. In exchange, she takes -2 to her Dwarf and Goblin bloodlines. Her studious life has done little to prepare her for the dangers found outside
of court. Her final bloodline scores are, then, Dwarf 3, Elf 8, Goblin 3, and Halfling 6. 

Before the first play session, Oxyehenhuain increments her Elf bloodline, bringing it to 9. Her mind, honed on ancient scrolls, is now taking in all the details of the outside world. 

## Tor Byorn Yorgensen

Tor Byorn Yorgensen is described as follows:

> Tor Byorn Yorgensen is a sturdy young man from the mountains whose shoulders
> are impressively wide and whose arms and legs bulge with barely contained
> strength. Although he has a deep sense of honor and duty towards those who
> cannot defend themselves, he is bullheaded and has an abrasive personality
> that makes him difficult to get along with – so difficult in fact that he
> was exiled from his village and told not to return until he learned some
> manners.
>
> Ever since, Tor Byorn has survived by being too tough (and too stubborn) to
> die. He is never far from his two-handed hammer, with which he often charges
> in to fights that do not concern him to defend those he views as in need of
> help (whether they agree or not)!

Tor Byorn takes +4 to his Dwarf bloodline. He's an excellent problem solver... but only when it comes to problems that can be solved by smashing something. In exchange, he takes -1 to his Elf and Goblin bloodlines and -2 to his Halfling bloodline. He's not one for subtlety, diplomacy, or books. His final bloodline scores are, then, Dwarf 9, Elf 4, Goblin 4, and Halfling 3. 

Before the first play session, Tor Byorn takes the Stoneform spell. The manifestation of this power is what spurned him to take on the life of a traveling adventurer!
