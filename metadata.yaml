title: 'Bloodlines'
subtitle: 'A Roleplaying Game'
author: 'Charles McEachern'
editor: 'Alexander Gude'
abstract: |
    The world is old but Humanity is young. As magic's influence ebbs, and the
    ancient peoples with it, the world's dark and dangerous places are
    bequeathed to a people with only a whisper of their ancestors' power.
