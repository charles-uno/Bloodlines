# Game Mastering

**Maybe Alex will write this chapter for me. I don't even know if the title is supposed to be one word or two.**

**The section breakdown in this chapter is highly tentative.**

**how to guide your players -- especially new ones -- as they figure out their characters**

**Conservation of Details.** Only use as many NPCs and locations as you need. Players can only keep track of so much.

**The GM is not the author.** Don't expect the players to follow a script. You can't predict their plays. Come up with a world where there are problems, and drop hints about them. Let the PCs choose which problems to address, and by what means. Problems that get ignored can cause complications down the road. 

**The GM is not the enemy.** Root for the PCs. Be a fan of the PCs. You're not trying to kill them, or beat them. You're providing challenges for them to overcome. 

**Length of a campaign.** Bloodlines is probably best for campaigns of not much more than a dozen sessions? Eventually scores get really high.
