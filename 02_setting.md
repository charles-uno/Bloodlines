# Setting

At the dawn of the world, three peoples awakened: the Dwarves in the northern mountains, the Elves in the eastern forests, and the Halflings in the western grasslands. For centuries, each lived isolated, oblivious to the existence of the others. 

There came a time of exploration, then colonization, then conflict; entire generations were lost to perennial warfare. Finally, historical enmities were set aside, giving way to a time of coexistence, commerce, and prosperity. The world saw the creation of titanic momuments, powerful artifacts, and fantastical creatures. Its fruits impregnate every corner of the world.

It was not just culture and magic that were exchanged during this time, of course. Through a hundred generations of political marriages and forbidden loves, bloodlines intermingled, creating an entirely new people: Humans.

Humanity inherited the strongest qualities of its parents -- the strength of the Dwarves and the charm of the Halflings -- but not their magical gifts. The vast majority of Humans exhibit no magical ability at all, and the few powers that do appear are modest in comparison to those of its progenitors.

As if in sympathy to Humanity's rise, the world's magic diminishes. Artifacts crumble. Creatures turn on their creators. The magic that remains is chaotic and dangerous.

Many among the ancient peoples view this change as an omen that their stewardship over the world has ended. The majestic Elvish cities shut their gates; their populations dwindle. Halflings take pilgrimages to the edges of the world, never to return. All the while, Humanity's population swells. Towns and trading posts spread across the world.

Humanity is not the only thing that grows, however. As ancient magic recedes, the wilderness reasserts itself, becoming more savage and feral than any time in living memory. Dark and perilous places surround and isolate every road and encampment. Even the largest Human city is no more than a stone's throw from the untamed wilds.

None can say whether Humanity will survive its coming of age. If it does, it will be by the bravery and bloodshed of so-called adventurers -- the precious few Humans who manifest whispers of ancient magic, and are pressed into service for the sake of all Humanity.

## Dwarves

The world's northmost reaches are crowned by mountains. Within these mountains live the Dwarves. Their cities, mines, and forges are carved into the living stone, and connected to one another by an expansive series of subterranean highways.

Dwarves are at least a head shorter than Humans, but weigh just as much (if not more) due to their sturdy builds. Their coloration comes in as many hues as the stone around them, from white marble to red clay to obsidian. Dwarven women braid their long, thick hair into elaborate patterns, woven with beads of precious metal and stone, while the men do the same with their beards. 

Dwarven society is orderly and traditional. Each city is made up of clans, and each clan within the city has its own role to fill, whether that be mining, smithing, or defending the city against the creatures of the deep earth. 

The Dwarves worship Valka, the Forgemother, who tends the world's molten core. It's said that she created the Dwarves with the first blow of her massive hammer, then breathed life into them with her bellows. Valka watches over miners, smiths, and warriors, and has dominion over the elements of stone, fire, and metal.

## Elves

The world's eastern highlands are blanketed by a dense redwood forest, the home of the Elves. Their halls and towers are suspended high above the forest floor, sculpted from the boughs and trunks of living trees. 

Compared to Humans, Elves are tall and willowy. Their arms and legs are slender, and their ears and chins are pointed. In place of hair, Elves grow manes of moss, ivy, and pine needles; they give off the smell of flowers and are often attended by bees and butterflies.  

Much like the giant redwoods, Elves are ancient. Births and deaths are rare. As a result, Elvish society is egalitarian, even to the erosion of individual identity. There is no heirarchy or leadership; Elves do not even claim professions or property. Every Elf is a ranger, an astronomer, a healer, and an architect, able to fill whatever role falls to them on a given day. 

Elves follow the twins Aso and Osa, the god and goddess of the sun and moon respectively. They watch over the world, day and night, and preside over nature, the seasons, the passage of time, and the cycle of life and death.

## Halflings

The west of the world is a massive grassland interspersed with hills, streams, and well-worn roads. These plains are home to the Halflings. They live in small, agrarian communities, each surrounded by vineyards, pastures, and fields of grain.

Halflings are short – far more so than the Dwarves – with round bellies and faces. They are naturally expressive, with large eyes and hands. Halflings have smooth cheeks, but sport dark, curly hair on their heads and on top of their almost-always-bare feet. 

Halfling society is familial. Children defer to their parents, who in turn defer to the local elders. Halflings traditionally greet one another as brother or sister, aunt or uncle, niece or nephew, even in the absence of blood relation. While there is no formal relationship between Halfling communities, trade between them is common; they also intermingle regularly due to the Halflings' penchant for festivals.

Halfling magic stems from Dina, the goddess of wine and revelry. She watches over all of her children, but most of all favors parents, lovers, and mischief-makers. Dina holds dominion over charms and illusions.

## Humans

Unlike the other peoples of the world, Humans have no ancestral homeland. Their settlements crop up haphazardly as the other peoples recede, thrown together from little more than fieldstones and thatch. Some Humans are fortunate enough to instead make their homes in cities abandoned by the other peoples. The most famous of these is the Human capital, **XXX**, a once-great marketplace built where the three realms of the world come together. 

Physically, Humans are not so sturdily built as the Dwarves, nor so tall as the Elves, nor so plump as the Halflings. Elements of each of the three original peoples can be seen in Humanity, though they have been blurred together. 

Human lifespans are relatively short, and their settlements relatively independent from one another, so culture varies widely from region to region. Perhaps the only universal practice is observation of the Midsummer Revel. At the solstice, each Human with a newly manifested power makes the trek to **XXX** to enlist as an adventurer. There are only a handful of new adventurers each year, but they are viewed with such hope and reverence that Humans travel from around the world to join in the festivities. 

Most Humans worship a pantheon of gods and goddesses. Though their names change regionally, most observe a mother figure who grants strength, a father who grants skill, an elder who grants wisdom, and so on. Humans rarely encounter magic, however, so most are ignorant of the connections between the deities and their respective magical domains.
