# Nonplayer Characters

**TODO: basically rewrite this chapter. description is no longer analogous to the PCs. do we need a way of formalizing GM notes about an NPC? it would sure be nice. what about a character sheet for an NPC? gross.**

**since they no longer match up with PCs, I think that NPCs are probably referred to by level now, rather than wounds.**

The focus in Bloodlines is on the PCs. As a result, mechanically, NPCs are
truly minimal. They are defined entirely by their description and their number
of wounds, both of which are set at the discretion of the GM.

While PC character sheets are visible to everyone, only the GM knows the
details of NPCs. Player knowledge of an NPC is limited to what their PCs
know.

## Description

NPC descriptions are analogous to PC descriptions. Both illustrate the
character's strengths and weaknesses, the circumstances that brought them into
the story, and the motivations that guide their ongoing actions.

The difference between them is how they apply to die rolls. Whereas a PC's
description guides the player as they assign their bloodline scores, an NPC's
description guides the GM as they assign levels to rolls. Clever PCs who
take advantage of an NPC's weaknesses may find themselves rolling at
levels lower than the NPC's level would suggest (for example, making a Minor roll against a Significant NPC), while careless NPCs may end up
rolling at higher levels (such as an Incredible roll made against a
Significant NPC).

Because of the importance of an NPC's description in determining roll
levels, it's crucial that it focus on details that might be important to
the NPC's interaction with PCs. Is the NPC intelligent, or capable of speech?
What might motivate it to attack a group of PCs, and how might it go about
doing so? What would the PCs be able to learn about this NPC, either from
researching it at a library or from speaking to the locals who have dealt with
it?

## Wounds

**Rework this. This section should perhaps be called Level instead of Wounds. It's more precise, but less consistent with the PC chapter.**

Like rolls, NPCs come in four levels: **Minor**, **Significant**,
**Incredible**, and **Legendary**, corresponding to **1**, **3**, **5**, and
**7** wounds respectively. An NPC is defeated if all of their wounds are
marked.

The NPC's number of wounds is chosen by the GM to reflect the NPC's size and
durability, as well as how interesting the NPC would be during a fight.  An
adversary who expects to simply trade a few blows back and forth with the PCs
should have few wounds, even if it is large, to prevent encounters from
becoming repetitive. Conversely, an NPC which is likely to provide a dynamic
and engaging confrontation (or one meant to make the PCs question their choice to
fight it) may be given a large number of wounds, even if it's small.

An NPC's level also serves as a starting point when establishing the
level of a roll taken against that NPC – most rolls taken against a
Significant NPC should be Significant, for example.  Relatedly,
most NPCs should have few wounds. The relative scarcity of Legendary monsters
– and the association of Legendary NPCs with Legendary rolls – serves to
maintain the tension and excitement that they bring.
