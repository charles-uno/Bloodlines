# Appendix III: Sample Spells

**Explain here how people can come up with their own spells? These are immersive, in-world abilities each with a variety of uses. Or does this go in the PC section, where we explain what spells are? I think it goes here.**

**Note that rolls for a spell always use the bloodline associated with that spell. Even at-will spells can prompt rolls, depending on the effect. For example, if you want to cannonball onto a bunch of enemies using Stoneform, the roll would measure your coordination and aim. If you want to call in some fog for cover using Stormcall, the roll would test how thick of a fog Opochi felt fit to bless you with.**

## Dwarf Spells

- **Immobolize Metal**: You can, by touching a piece of metal, render it absolutely immobile, even resisting the effects of gravity. This ability can be used to hold a door shut. It can restrain an NPC by locking their armor in place. It can even be used to climb hand-over-hand straight up into the air, by holding a pair of ladder rungs and alternating which is immobile. 
- **Stoneform**: You can turn yourself (as well as your clothing and posessions) into an indestructible stone statue. The transformation takes only a moment. While in statue form, you remain aware of your surroundings, and can change back at will. This ability can be used to lock an NPC into a grapple by becoming rigid around them. It can be use to create cover for other PCs. A PC could even jump from a ledge and petrify in midair to come crashing down into a group of enemies. 
- **Summon Fire**: You can, at will, summon and dismiss a fist-sized orb of fire. The fire casts light as a torch. It is hot enough to ignite small objects, or to warm a few PCs huddled around it. Touching a character with the orb for more than a moment or two can also cause significant burns. The orb hovers near its summoner like a torch, and can also be directed to move as they like, anywhere within a few armspans. It cannot act autonomously, however, and will slowly return to its summoner if left undirected. This ability can be used to illuminate dark areas, distract NPCs, start fires, and trigger traps. 

## Elf Spells

- **Chronokinesis**: You can shunt objects forward in time. You can cause any nonliving object that you can hold in your hands to vanish, then reappear at the exact same location at a later point in time. This ability is useful for hiding objects. It can similarly be used to smuggle things into an area that is only guarded at select times. It can even, if the PC's foresight is good enough, set up traps and ambushes. 
- **Animal Bond**: You can form a bond with any willing animal. The animal must be within a few armspans of you when you form the bond, though it need not remain that close. The bond is lost if the animal feels panic or suffers an injury. While bonded with the animal, you can experience everything it does – you share its sight, hearing, etc. You can also communicate telepathically with the animal, even directing its actions (for as long as it tolerates the intrusion). This ability has many uses, including spying, navigating, and communicating over long distances. 
- **Shape Wood**: You can, with a touch, cause wood (either living or dead) to change its shape. This effect is limited to a volume no more than an armspan in each direction, and can neither create nor destroy material. This ability can be used to warp an opponents bow or shield into an unusable bramble, to fabricate all manner of mundane objects (ladders, kindling, caltrops, etc), and even fold back locked doors or walls to allow passage. 

## Goblin spells

- **Stormcall**: You can control the weather around yourself, calling down all sorts of weather patterns or precipitation. This ability can be used to call in a concealing fog. It can assault enemies (and possibly friends) with hail and lightning. It can also summon gusts of wind to push things around. 
- **Spider Climb**: You can easily support your weight by nothing more than the tiny cracks and imperfections present in ordinary stone, wood, and masonry. This allows you to climb sheer walls and even hang on ceilings. This ability can be used to hide in a small space (nobody ever looks up!), to circumvent traps or obstacles, or to scale sheer surfaces such as walls or the outsides of towers. 
- **Water Affinity**: You can breathe underwater as easily as in air. You can walk on water at will. You can also create fresh water from nothing, fast enough to fill a goblet in a moment or two. This ability can make dangerous or difficult locations more accessible. It can also be invaluable on long voyages, for extinguishing fires, or when hosts can't be trusted to provide safe water to drink. 


## Halfling spells

- **Charm**: You can cast a charm on an NPC. Only one NPC can be charmed at a time. Charmed NPCs treat the charmer (and any companions) as close friends, and happily comply with any requests the PCs make. The charm is immediately broken if the NPC feels threatened or suffers a wound. This spell can be used to gain information from an NPC that might otherwise be unhelpful. Charmed NPCs can also carry out favors for the PCs, which often amounts to nothing more than creating a distraction.
- **Illusion**: You can cause others to perceive false (but convincing) sights, sounds, and smells. Illusions can be no larger in scale than an armspan in every direction, though the GM may relax this rule to allow very simple illusions (perhaps a wall with no accompanying sound or smell) to be larger. The sound and smell created can never be of such a scale that it causes an NPC harm. If any NPCs are present when the illusion is created the GM will likely call for a roll, and additional rolls may be necessary as NPCs interact with the illusion or subject it to particular scrutiny. This spell can be used to create disguises, by layering a false image over a PC's face or clothing. It can be used to intimidate aggressors by presenting a fearsome monster. It is also useful for creating distractions, for example the sound of battle or screaming which appears to come from a particular direction. 
- **Read Mind**: You can read the surface thoughts of those around you – you can listen in on their internal monologues. This is more difficult, though not impossible, if they are specifically trying to keep their thoughts hidden. This ability is useful for surreptitiously gathering information, see through a deception or disguise, or prepare to put into motion a deception or disguise of your own.
