# Player Characters

**What is a PC?**

**Who can see the information on a PC's character sheet?**

## Description

**This essay could likely use some work. It has been copy-pasted through several reworkings.**

**Can the description be considered by the GM when assigning roll level? Previously it could not. I like having the level of a roll decoupled from a character sheet. However, people tend to just ignore their descriptions.**

The most fundamental aspect of a PC is the description. This is a place for the player to keep track of their PC's background, personality, motivations, and any other details that might be used to guide the PC's actions during play.

Writing a PC's description can be a collaborative effort. Players are encouraged to talk to each other to figure out ideas for interesting backstories, relationships between the PCs, and what specifically has brought them together. The GM should be part of this discussion as well, in order to provide relevant details about the in-game world.... as well as to take note of people and places mentioned in the PCs' descriptions which may later be leveraged to create engaging plot hooks. 

The descriptions is also used to illustrate the equipment each PC carries. There is no formal handling of items or currency in Bloodlines, so the description is used to judge holistically whether a PC seems like they would carry lockpicks, a spyglass, an extra weapon, rope, and other gear.

Players have complete freedom over their PCs' descriptions. They may update them at any time in order to track important or unusual items, new relationships with NPCs, and so on.

A PC's description – in fact, everything on the PC's character sheet – is public information. It need not be hidden from other players or from the GM. There is one exception, however: if a PC is specifically withholding something from the other PCs, that player may withhold the same information from the other players. This is best done in anticipation of a dramatic reveal!

## Bloodline Scores

**What are bloodline scores?**

**How are bloodline scores initialized?**

**How do bloodline scores advance?**

The bloodlines themselves are described as follows.

-   The Dwarf bloodline imparts strength, endurance, and skill-at-arms. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to grapple, brawl, kick down doors, run long distances, and use swords, axes, spears, and other hand-to-hand weapons. It also defends against melee attackers and exposure to the elements – the GM may request a Dwarf roll for a PC to deflect a grapple, parry an incoming sword, or stomach a poison.
-   The Elf bloodline imparts knowledge, perceptiveness, and natural affinity. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to forage, track, handle animals, make educated guesses, and recall facts about history, monsters, and geography. It also defends against ignorance and hidden dangers – the GM may request an Elf roll for a PC to notice an impending ambush, to recall a pertinent detail about an NPC, or to understand a new language being spoken nearby.
-   The Goblin bloodline imparts reflexes, coordination, and stealthiness. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to pick locks, pick pockets, move silently, and attack with ranged and thrown weapons. It also defends against detection and against projectiles – the GM may request a Goblin roll for a PC to remain hidden despite pursuers, or to duck out of the way of an incoming arrow or falling rock. 
-   The Halfling bloodline imparts social savvy, charisma, and willpower. A high score will improve a PC's rolls to provoke, intimidate, barter, build rapport, entertain, create disguises, and lie. It also defends against deception and coercion – the GM may call for a Halfling roll for a PC to judge an NPC's trustworthiness, or maintain composure when faced with a tense or confrontational social situation.

## Spells

In addition to bloodline scores, a PC's ancestry also provides them with
spells. A spell is a whisper of the magical powers of the ancient peoples,
which can bubble up through a PC's hereditary memory. 

All PCs have access to spells, but it bears noting that they are otherwise
rare. Most humans never know a spell; many never even meet someone who does.
Learning a new spell is always an event of note... though different sects of
Humanity disagree about which spells are good omens and which are bad.

## Wounds

Each PC can sustain four wounds. Wounds are boxes on the character sheet which are marked off to indicate any sort of stress – physical or mental – inflicted on the PC. When all four are marked off, the PC is defeated. 

Physical wounds indicate bodily injury due to brawls, poisons, weapons, and so on. Defeat by physical wounds causes physical incapacitation. The PC may (per the GM's discretion) be conscious and able to speak, but they cannot move or defend themselves. Given the chance, any NPC can easily kill them. 

Mental wounds indicate damaged resolve, willpower, or self-control as a result of intimidation, provocation, or coercion. Defeat by mental wounds causes mental incapacitation. Depending on the situation (as judged by the GM) this may mean that the PC concedes an argument, breaks composure in a delicate social situation, or becomes so flustered that they can no longer form a coherent thought.

Physical and mental wounds are marked identically, using the same four boxes. It's rare that a single confrontation will cause both mental and physical stress. However, should a PC enter a physical confrontation before recovering from mental wounds, or vice versa, they will find that their fatigue carries over. 

Wounds are recovered in dramatically appropriate time. A short rest immediately after the confrontation is sufficient to unmark a single wound. All wounds are unmarked after a long rest, such as a hot meal or a night of sleep somewhere safe.
