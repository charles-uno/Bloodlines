# Player Characters

**What is a PC?**

**TODO: add a mention of the magical domains that go with each bloodline, since they now explicitly include a coupling to the gods.**

**Point to the next chapter, which has sample PCs...?**

**TODO: intermingle example PC creation into this chapter? how many sample PCs do we need?**

**TODO: rather than generic wounds, have them correspond to the scores. also they no longer cover social stress.**

A PC's character sheet is public; it need not be hidden from the GM or from the other players. There is one exception, however. If a PC is specifically withholding a piece of information from the other PCs, that information may be withheld from the other players as well. This is best done in anticipation of a dramatic reveal!

## Notes

**TODO: write this section. It's where players can write whatever they want. Unutual items carried, motivations, relationships with NPCs, whatever. It will probably start short and grow as the game goes on. I have left the old *description* essay for reference.**

The most fundamental aspect of a PC is the description. This is a place for the player to keep track of their PC's background, personality, motivations, and any other details that might be used to guide the PC's actions during play. 

Players are encouraged to talk to each other to figure out ideas for interesting backstories, relationships between the PCs, and what specifically has brought them together. The GM should be part of this discussion as well, in order to provide relevant details about the in-game world.... as well as to take note of people and places mentioned in the PCs' descriptions which may later be leveraged to create engaging plot hooks. 

A PC's description is used to eyeball the sorts of equipment a PC carries. There is no formal handling of items or currency in Bloodlines. If the PCs find themselves wanting lockpicks, a spyglass, some rope, or a disguise kit, they'll need to assess whether it would make sense for any of them to be carrying such a thing. 

Players have complete freedom over their PCs' descriptions. They may update them at any time in order to note important or unusual items, new relationships with NPCs, and so on. 

## Trade, Power, Service, Ethos

**TODO: write this essay!**

Trade. Life is hard on the frontier. For the most part, you were probably defined by your job before your power manifested itself. What did you do? Were you a builder? baker? farmer? soldier? lumberjack? How advanced is human civilization -- do jobs like pickpocket and scholar exist? Probably? Subsistence farming isn't very exciting. This is something you can come up with yourself if you like -- the input of others isn't super important here. 

Power. Very rarely -- perhaps just a handful of times per generation -- a hint of ancient power manifests inself in an unwitting human. You are one such human. What is your power? Check out the appendix for examples or work with your GM to come up with one of your own. It's ideal that you have a power when the game starts, since people without powers are not adventurers.

Service. When your power manifested, you were drafted as an adventurer. On behalf of all of humanity, you explore the unknown and confront the dangers that live there. What onus, specifically, had been placed upon you? You should work with your group to figure these out. Not everyone needs to have the same task, but they should at least fit together. The PCs need to all share the story with one another, after all. 

Ethos. Even if you dreamed of being an adventurer, nothing in your life could have truly prepared you for it. How have you reacted? Do you embrace your new responsibility or resent it? What sort of world are you working to build for humanity? This is something you should talk to your GM and other players about, though you don't need to agree on everything -- disagreement can lead to interesting party dynamics!

## Bloodline Scores

The strengths and weaknesses of a PC are expressed through their four bloodline scores. These scores are numbers which illustrate how well the PC (as a Human) embodies the abilities of the four ancient peoples, and also show how favorably they are seen by the ancient peoples' gods. A Human whose Elf bloodline manifests strongly will be innately sharp-eyed, for example, and will take naturally to the magical domains of Aso and Osa. A strong Goblin bloodline, on the other hand, indicates a PC who is innately agile and looked upon favorably by Opochi. 

During play, bloodline scores indicate the number of dice that players use to make rolls. A higher bloodline score causes a player to roll more dice, which in turn improves the PC's odds of success in actions related to that score. 

Over the course of their adventures, a PC's bloodline scores gradually increase. This indicates the PC becoming stronger and more clever as a result of their experiences, as well as earning divine favor by amusing the gods. The gods are capricious, however, so these score increases manifest unpredictably. 

Bloodline scores are set at the beginning of each session. To do so, each player rolls twenty four-sided dice, plus an additional one for each session that's been played. That is, twenty-one dice are rolled at the beginning of the second session, twenty-two at the beginning of the third session, and so on. If any numbers do not show up (no dice show "1", for example), the roll must be tried again. 

The die are divided into four piles by value. The sizes of the four piles are then assigned to the PC's bloodline scores. The relative order of the scores should remain unchanged from session to session – Tor Byorn Yorgensen always assigns his highest score to his Dwarf bloodline and his lowest score to his Halfling bloodline, for example. 

The meaning of each bloodline score is explained in detail below: 

+ **The Dwarf bloodline imparts strength, endurance, and skill-at-arms.** A high score will improve a PC's rolls to grapple, brawl, kick down doors, physically intimidate adversaries, run long distances, and use swords, axes, spears, and other hand-to-hand weapons. It also defends against melee attackers and exposure to the elements – the GM may request a Dwarf roll for a PC to deflect a grapple, parry an incoming sword, or stomach a poison.
+ **The Elf bloodline imparts knowledge, perceptiveness, and natural affinity.** A high score will improve a PC's rolls to forage, track, handle animals, make educated guesses, and recall facts about history, monsters, and geography. It also defends against ignorance and hidden dangers – the GM may request an Elf roll for a PC to notice an impending ambush, to recall a pertinent detail about an NPC, or to understand a new language being spoken nearby.
+ **The Goblin bloodline imparts reflexes, coordination, and stealthiness.** A high score will improve a PC's rolls to pick locks, pick pockets, move silently, and attack with ranged and thrown weapons. It also defends against detection and against projectiles – the GM may request a Goblin roll for a PC to remain hidden despite pursuers, or to duck out of the way of an incoming arrow or falling rock.
+ **The Halfling bloodline imparts social savvy, charisma, and willpower.** A high score will improve a PC's rolls to provoke, intimidate, barter, build rapport, entertain, create disguises, and lie. It also defends against deception and coercion – the GM may call for a Halfling roll for a PC to judge an NPC's trustworthiness, or maintain composure when faced with a tense or confrontational social situation.

**TODO: spells no longer exist. some of this goes in the discussion of Power. the rest gets cut.**

## Spells

In addition to bloodline scores, a PC's ancestry also provides them with
spells. A spell is a whisper of the magical powers of the ancient peoples,
which can bubble up through a PC's hereditary memory. 

All PCs have access to spells, but it bears noting that they are otherwise
rare. Most humans never know a spell; many never even meet someone who does.
Learning a new spell is always an event of note... though different sects of
Humanity disagree about which spells are good omens and which are bad.

At the beginning of each play session, if a player chooses not in increase one of their PC's bloodline scores, that PC instead learns a spell. Any PC is able to learn any spell, regardless of what spells they already know, and regardless of what their corresponding bloodline scores are. 

It bears noting that a PC will be most effective in using a spell if their corresponding bloodline score is high. Should the GM call for a roll as part of using a Dwarf spell, for example, that roll will always be made with the Dwarf bloodline score. This is discussed more fully in the next chapter.

Players can choose spells from the spell list in the Appendix. In addition, GMs are encouraged to write their own spells; the Appendix also includes advive to help in this endeavor. 

## Wounds

**TODO: Broken, Stunned, Staggered, Shaken.** Each of the four wounds hampers the corresponding bloodline score. Whenever you get hit, it's random which gets checked. The GM rolls it behind the screen. If you would make a roll and your corresponding box is checked, instead roll it one level up. If you would take a hit but all of your boxes are checked, you are killed. You never lie around incapacitated waiting to get killed -- you are fighting to your last breath. Recovery probably still matches as before. You get to choose which one you recover after a short rest. 

Each PC can sustain four wounds. Wounds are boxes on the character sheet which are marked off to indicate any sort of stress – physical or mental – inflicted on the PC. When all four are marked off, the PC is defeated. 

Physical wounds indicate bodily injury due to brawls, poisons, weapons, and so on. Defeat by physical wounds causes physical incapacitation. The PC may (per the GM's discretion) be conscious and able to speak, but they cannot move or defend themselves. Given the chance, any NPC can easily kill them. 

Mental wounds indicate damaged resolve, willpower, or self-control as a result of intimidation, provocation, or coercion. Defeat by mental wounds causes mental incapacitation. Depending on the situation (as judged by the GM) this may mean that the PC concedes an argument, breaks composure in a delicate social situation, or becomes so flustered that they can no longer form a coherent thought.

Physical and mental wounds are marked identically, using the same four boxes. It's rare that a single confrontation will cause both mental and physical stress. However, should a PC enter a physical confrontation before recovering from mental wounds, or vice versa, they will find that their fatigue carries over. 

Wounds are recovered in dramatically appropriate time. A short rest immediately after the confrontation is sufficient to unmark a single wound. All wounds are unmarked after a long rest, such as a hot meal or a night of sleep somewhere safe.
